title: A Random NTSC-U/C Modern Nintendo Game Variant List
description: I've accumulated a small list of games I've been interested in over
  the last few months - consider the list yours to use!
---

Sometimes the craving hits you for a particular game - you need to have it in your collection, but knowing as much as I do about variants and the complexities of them, I can't just buy any old copy.

Often, I'll seek out an early variant, or simply determine which variant I find most interesting or relevant to my nostalgia. For this reason, I often just make a list of as many variants I can find, often just USA/Canadian variants.

---

With that said, here is a brief list of games and their variants, including product codes, satellite codes, and other useful information.

If you haven't already, I recommend reading my semi-comprehensive [guide to understanding modern Nintendo print variants](/essays/decoding-modern-nintendo-print-variants). I've tried to structure the data below in a way that will both look familiar and be easy to digest according to that guide.

Consider these ordered starting with (what I've concluded to be) first print, down to most recent (or last) print. These are a mixture of retail and special edition copies.

Additionally, please note this list is not comprehensive. If you'd like me to add other variants or simply have corrections for me, feel free to reach out at [contact@afew.games](mailto:contact@afew.games).

Enjoy!

## Mario Kart 8 (Wii U)

This iteration of _Mario Kart_ was released just a bit before _amiibo_ hit store shelves in the USA. This is why the "USA" variant is the earliest, as it has no mention of amiibo and uses the legacy Nintendo Network badge.

| Product Code | Satellite Code | Country | MPN | Notes                                                   |

| 82909A       | 00100          | USA     |     | Nintendo Network Badge                                  |
| 82909B       | 00101          | USA     |     | Nintendo Network Badge                                  |
| 83055A       | 00100          | USA     |     | NFR, Nintendo Network Badge, 2014 Wii U 32GB Deluxe Set |
| 101514A      | 00100          | USA     |     | "amiibo" badge, "amiibo" no TM                          |
| 101979A      | 00000          | Japan   |     | "amiibo" badge, "amiibo" with TM                        |

## Mario Kart 8 Deluxe (Switch)

| Product Code | Satellite Code | Country | MPN | Notes             |
| ------------ | -------------- | ------- | --- | ----------------- |
| 105278A      | 00000          | Japan   |     |                   |
| 105278B      | 00001          | Japan   |     |                   |
| 105278C      | 00002          | Japan   |     | English & Spanish |

## Super Mario Odyssey (Switch)

Most notable about Super Mario in this generation is its special edition pack, dubbed "starter pack." Its pack-in game has a different product code than whats on the box, which is a first in my (very limited) experience documenting variants for modern Nintendo games.

| Product Code | Satellite Code | Country | MPN | Notes                       |
| ------------ | -------------- | ------- | --- | --------------------------- |
| 105882A      | 00000          | Japan   |     |                             |
| 105882B      | 00001          | Japan   |     |                             |
| 105882C      | 00002          | Japan   |     |                             |
| 108795A      |                | Japan   |     | "Starter pack" Box          |
| 108807A      | 00000          | Japan   |     | NFR, "starter pack" Pack-In |

## Super Smash Bros Ultimate (Switch)

Notable for this release is the special edition (dubbed "Ultimate Edition"), where there isn't a standard retail copy of the game inside, but rather a steel book. As a result you won't see any codes except on the outer big box.

| Product Code | Satellite Code | Country | MPN | Notes                                                            |
| ------------ | -------------- | ------- | --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 108491A      | 00000          | Japan   |     |                                                                  |
| 108491B      | 00001          | Japan   |     |                                                                  |
| 108613A      | 00000          | Japan   |     | "Ultimate Edition" controller bundle (English, Spanish & French) |
| 108492A      | 00000          | Japan   |     | Canadian release (English & French)                              |

## Metroid Prime: Hunters (DS)

As noted in my print variant guide, this iteration of Metroid is an example of a game missing a product code. Specifically, `57096A`. This is likely due to a production error early in the first print run. As a result, `57096B` is the earliest product code you're likely to find.

| Product Code | Satellite Code | Country | MPN | Notes            |
| ------------ | -------------- | ------- | --- | ---------------- |
| 57096B       | 00001          | Japan   |     |
| 57096C       | 00002          | Japan   |     |
| 57102A       | 00000          | Japan   |     | Canadian release |
| 57102B       | 00001          | Japan   |     | Canadian release |

## Bayonetta 2 (Wii U)

Similar to Metroid, above, we covered this in the modern Nintendo variants guide. Unfortunately Platinum and Nintendo shipped their first version of this game with an incorrect satellite code. _Made in USA_ variants will always use `00100`, using the middle digit to denote the game is USA printed. [ModernDB](https://www.instagram.com/moderndatabase/) confirmed this is a common trend for the developer.

| Product Code | Satellite Code | Country | MPN | Notes                                   |
| ------------ | -------------- | ------- | --- | --------------------------------------- |
| 83663A       | 00000          | USA     |     | Satellite code error, bonus Bayonetta 1 |
| 83663B       | 00100          | USA     |     | Bonus Bayonetta 1                       |
| 100178A      | 00100          | USA     |     | Bonus Bayonetta 1                       |
| 103567A      | 00000          | Japan   |     |
