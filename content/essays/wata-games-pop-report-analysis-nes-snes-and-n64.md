title: "Wata Games Pop Report Analysis: NES, SNES, and N64"
description: A breakdown of seal grades across the breakthrough home consoles
---
This is a follow up to a similar article I published last week, [Wata Games Pop Report Analysis: Game Boy](https://www.afew.games/essays/seal-grades-are-here-for-wata-graded-games), where I shared both high level and focused analyses of each Game Boy-era pop report. Now that we have seal grades available, we can finally get a sense of how seal grades play into the top graded games.

One thing the previous post exposed for me is that, despite A++ and A+ supposedly being the highest grades to get on a seal, they were surprisingly common! This could be explained in many ways. For one, collectors will likely send in what they think are the best looking games. Another factor to think about is Wata's relatively young age; they've only been grading since late 2018; compare that to VGA, Wata's current main competitor, where they opened in 2008! I bring this up because Wata has openly stated many folks sent in their best games in the early days, both VGA graded and ungraded. 

Regardless of the reasons, it's clear there are a number of high grade games out there, and so the logical next step is that the highest grades will become fewer and further between. Worth watching are some of the [initial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvYFoQmxfxo) [analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSm5ucH-Hk) [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgl5DtD1Jdo) by GetTheGregGames on YouTube. Overall, Nintendo has tended to average between 9.2-9.6. Very interesting indeed!

As a caveat to the below data, remember: games submitted to Wata won't and will never be able to represent the wider collecting hobby. This is mainly due to the fact that the hobby and its community is still very small when compared to the larger collecting sphere, and the motivations of grading are at least partially skewed by the highest value items.

Same as before, we'll break down each console into a few metrics:

* Seal grade totals
* Seal grade breakdown across each box grade, starting at 9.0
* The top five submitted games

## Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)

High level seal grade breakdown:

| Seal Grade   | Total | % of Total |
| ------------ | ----- | ---------- |
| A++          | 713   | 6.19%      |
| A+           | 4241  | 36.81%     |
| A            | 4432  | 38.47%     |
| B+           | 1509  | 13.10%     |
| B            | 388   | 3.37%      |
| C+           | 100   | 0.87%      |
| C            | 8     | 0.07%      |
| NS           | 131   | 1.14%      |
| Total Graded | 11522 | 100.00%    |

Of note is the huge submission total at over 11,000 NES games. According to Wata, NES is the single most-submitted platform. PS1 is a "close" second at... 6282 submissions total (modern consoles might be more, but we don't have those numbers yet).

Similarly, there's a distinct drop off from A+ to A++. 

Here are the box grades starting at 9.0:

| Box Grade         | A++   | A+     | A      | B+    | B     | C+    | C     | NS    | Box Total |
| ----------------- | ----- | ------ | ------ | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | --------- |
| 10                | 2     | 0      | 0      | 0     | 0     | 0     | 0     | 0     | 2         |
| 9.8               | 230   | 398    | 61     | 1     | 0     | 0     | 0     | 0     | 690       |
| 9.6               | 207   | 1029   | 398    | 16    | 2     | 0     | 0     | 1     | 1653      |
| 9.4               | 146   | 1188   | 926    | 111   | 18    | 0     | 0     | 13    | 2402      |
| 9.2               | 56    | 562    | 758    | 154   | 30    | 5     | 0     | 15    | 1580      |
| 9                 | 26    | 315    | 575    | 166   | 25    | 4     | 1     | 20    | 1132      |
| Seal Total        | 667   | 3492   | 2718   | 448   | 75    | 9     | 1     | 49    | 7459      |
| % of Total Graded | 5.79% | 30.31% | 23.59% | 3.89% | 0.65% | 0.08% | 0.01% | 0.43% | 64.74%    |

In addition to seal grade totals, we can also see the total games graded at each box level. Here, roughly 65% of all NES games graded at 9.0 or higher, and about 36% of all games graded were both 9.0 or higher, and A+ or higher. 

And of course, the top 10 submitted games:

| Title                            | Total Graded | % of Total Graded | Notable Figures                                                                            |

It's clear Mario and Zelda are the big kids on the playground.

Of interest for those unaware of how rare early print Nintendo games are, is the starkly low count for test market variants of Super Mario Bros. (matte and gloss sticker seals), and three total copies of the earliest known Legend of Zelda print. These are truly rare games for iconic franchises, where [folks have paid hundreds of thousands](https://www.ha.com/heritage-auctions-press-releases-and-news/-legend-of-zelda-shatters-world-record-at-870-000-to-kick-off-heritage-auctions-video-games-event.s?releaseId=4241) for them.

## Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES)

First, the high level seal grade breakdow

| Seal Grade   | Total | % of Total |
| ------------ | ----- | ---------- |
| A++          | 811   | 15.48%     |
| A++          | 1998  | 38.14%     |
| A            | 1643  | 31.36%     |
| B+           | 573   | 10.94%     |
| B            | 152   | 2.90%      |
| C+           | 41    | 0.78%      |
| C            | 4     | 0.08%      |
| NS           | 17    | 0.32%      |
| Total Graded | 5239  | 100.00%    |

The 9.0 and up box grades should look familiar:

| Box Grade         | A++    | A+     | A      | B+    | B     | C+    | C     | NS    | Box Total |
| ----------------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | --------- |
| 10                | 4      | 0      | 0      | 0     | 0     | 0     | 0     | 0     | 4         |
| 9.8               | 233    | 108    | 9      | 0     | 0     | 0     | 0     | 1     | 351       |
| 9.6               | 197    | 322    | 83     | 5     | 2     | 0     | 0     | 1     | 610       |
| 9.4               | 214    | 503    | 270    | 39    | 8     | 2     | 0     | 4     | 1040      |
| 9.2               | 47     | 322    | 245    | 48    | 11    | 0     | 0     | 2     | 675       |
| 9                 | 45     | 218    | 249    | 62    | 10    | 1     | 0     | 2     | 587       |
| Seal Total        | 740    | 1473   | 856    | 154   | 31    | 3     | 0     | 10    | 3267      |
| % of Total Graded | 14.12% | 28.12% | 16.34% | 2.94% | 0.59% | 0.06% | 0.00% | 0.19% | 62.36%    |

Just like NES, over 60% of all games hit 9.0, although seal grades seem to hit A+ and higher more often.

Then, the top 10:

| Title                                     | Total Graded | % of Total Graded | Notable Figures                            |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------ | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| F-Zero                                    | 240          | 4.58%             | \*201 PC; 43 9.8 A++, 52 9.6 A++           |
| The Legend of Zelda: ALTTP                | 141          | 2.69%             | \*63 black label                           |
| Street Fighter II                         | 129          | 2.46%             |                                            |
| Super Mario Kart                          | 95           | 1.81%             | \*21 black label, 6 black label "game pak" |
| Super Star Wars (Nintendo)                | 95           | 1.81%             |                                            |
| Super Mario World                         | 93           | 1.78%             | \*38 black label                           |
| Donkey Kong Country                       | 92           | 1.76%             |                                            |
| Killer Instinct                           | 69           | 1.32%             |                                            |
| Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy Kong's Quest | 67           | 1.28%             | \*K-A rating pop 1 @ 8.0 A+                |
| Mortal Kombat                             | 67           | 1.28%             |                                            |
| Total                                     | 1088         | 20.77%            |                                            |

Interestingly, there is a higher concentration of often-submitted games in the top 10. Of note, there's an enormous supply of mint grade F-Zero in Player's Choice. Almost as many 9.8 A++ as there are 9.6 A++, with 240 graded. The sold prices of this game wouldn't surprise you.

Another interesting note: only 26 black label for Super Mario Kart. You'd think there'd be more!

## Nintendo 64 (N64)

On Nintendo 64, things get interesting. The patterns have something in common with SNES, but more on that in a moment.

First, the seal grade breakdown

| Seal Grade   | Total | % of Total |
| ------------ | ----- | ---------- |
| A++          | 1180  | 26.66%     |
| A+           | 2000  | 45.19%     |
| A            | 894   | 20.20%     |
| B+           | 262   | 5.92%      |
| B            | 68    | 1.54%      |
| C+           | 19    | 0.43%      |
| C            | 1     | 0.02%      |
| NS           | 2     | 0.05%      |
| Total Graded | 4426  | 100.00%    |

Slightly less overall games than SNES but a slightly wider gap between A+ and A++.

The box grade breakdown:

| Box Grade         | A++    | A+     | A     | B+    | B     | C+    | C     | NS    | Box Total |
| ----------------- | ------ | ------ | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | --------- |
| 10                | 2      | 0      | 0     | 0     | 0     | 0     | 0     | 0     | 2         |
| 9.8               | 230    | 50     | 1     | 0     | 0     | 0     | 0     | 0     | 281       |
| 9.6               | 295    | 191    | 13    | 3     | 1     | 0     | 0     | 0     | 503       |
| 9.4               | 312    | 331    | 43    | 15    | 1     | 0     | 0     | 1     | 703       |
| 9.2               | 142    | 287    | 70    | 7     | 3     | 0     | 0     | 1     | 510       |
| 9                 | 70     | 236    | 99    | 13    | 2     | 1     | 0     | 0     | 421       |
| Seal Total        | 1051   | 1095   | 226   | 38    | 7     | 1     | 0     | 2     | 2420      |
| % of Total Graded | 23.75% | 24.74% | 5.11% | 0.86% | 0.16% | 0.02% | 0.00% | 0.05% | 54.68%    |

Unlike its predecessors, only 54% of all games submitted received a 9.0 or better box grade, however far more games have better seal grades. Just shy of 50% received A+ or better.

And finally, the top 10:

| Title                    | Total Graded | % of Total Graded | Notable Figures                                                                                    |

Remember the pattern I mentioned for N64 vs. SNES? Well, Gauntlet Legends rivals F-Zero (Player's Choice) with over 200 submitted and over 55 each in 9.6 and 9.8, including a A++ seal grade. It reaches slightly closer to 5% of all games submitted. Up until very recently, you could still find sealed cases at auction, but now they seem to be spoken for.

A few areas stick out to me otherwise

* What's with the 15 copies of Pokemon Snap with 78% fiber (one of which is a pop one 9.8)? While it's a relatively uninteresting variant, it brings the question: were these earlier prints, or later prints? If an earlier print, then my 100% fiber variant is even less interesting when taking into account its grade (8.5 A aka the poor man grade).
* There are quite a few more collector's edition (CE) variants of both The Legend of Zelda games, but maybe that shouldn't be *too* surprising as they're far more sought after.

I hope this information is both educational and interesting! The hobby continues to grow and more interesting information coming out each month.

Tomorrow for instance, CGC might finally announce their new case design for their graded video games initiative. It's been over 400 days since they announced grading video games (then subsequently announcing grading VHS). Hopefully it was worth the wait!
