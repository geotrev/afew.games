description: Recent information adds clarity to early vs. later productions of
  the original Pokemon games

H﻿ave you missed me? Well, good news: variant updates on the first Pocket Monsters games have arrived!

Since before the first [variant guide](https://www.afew.games/essays/pocket-monsters-red-green-variant-guide) published to this website, I have stayed in conversations with [The Mikaifu Collection on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/mikaifucollection/) to get as much concrete information as possible. After all, [now that these games sell for tens of thousands of dollars](https://comics.ha.com/itm/video-games/nintendo/pocket-monsters-aka-vga-90-nm-mt-ns-unopened-game-boy-nintendo-1996-jpn/a/7372-28068.s?ic4=GalleryView-ShortDescription-071515), we better get this right!

## O﻿verview

G﻿iven light on recent sources, it can be considered more accurate to consider the variants for Red and Green "pre-production" and "launch production," with variants after retaining the usual mid-production and late-production monikers.

#### Pre-Order Production (LUPC)

The LUPC (large UPC) batch consisted of 100,000 Green and 130,000 Red copies (sources: [gamegyokai](http://www.gamegyokai.com/history/pokemon.htm), [mobile-gb](http://wiki.mobile-gb.com/index.php?title=%E3%83%9D%E3%82%B1%E3%83%83%E3%83%88%E3%83%A2%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B9%E3%82%BF%E3%83%BC_%E9%9D%92#:~:text=%E5%88%9D%E5%9B%9E%E5%87%BA%E8%8D%B7%E3%81%AF20%E4%B8%87,%E3%82%92%E4%B8%8A%E3%81%92%E3%82%8B%E3%81%93%E3%81%A8%E3%81%A8%E3%81%AA%E3%82%8B%25E3%2580%2582), and [itmedia](https://www.itmedia.co.jp/business/articles/1607/28/news046.html). These included survey inserts and were equipped with 00/22 cartridges. No sources exist to indicate continued production of LUPC versions beyond this pre-order batch, which explains the relative scarcity of these very early copies.

#### Launch Production (SUPC)

Following LUPC, the launch production (SUPC, or small UPC) began, marked by smaller UPC codes. These copies were also shipped with the survey inserts and `00`/`22` cartridge codes, indicating their close production timeline to the LUPC versions. Notably, by late March 1996, nearly 200,000 copies of Aka and Midori had been sold, suggesting a swift transition to SUPC production to meet ongoing demand.
