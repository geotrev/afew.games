title: The (Unfortunate) State of Graded Games
description: As fun and lucrative as graded games might seem, the hobby (and
  corporate industry) has a long way to go
---

I want to preface this by saying, I love to collect games. Grading games is largely a fun and enjoyable experience if you can find good deals and know what you're doing.

That said, I have some complaints. Some personal, some not-so personal.

1. Not enough competition. We have two graders, Wata and VGA (video game authority), and both have severe drawbacks. A third is entering the market soon (CGC).
2. Wata has several issues right now:

   * Poor quality control (the grade is off center on the label, low-ink labels, objects in the holder like hair, etc).
   * Not enough packaging when returning submissions to customers, resulting in broken cases.
   * Limited size options; can only submit standard-size games, meaning if you want to grade special editions, your only option is VGA.
   * If your game is standard but has a sleeve, it has a non-zero probability of being damaged when put into the inner blister. Thankfully Wata recently started informing customers that the sleeve must be removed on these games.
   * General optics and marketing problems. Wata's somewhat shady dealings in its early days have left many collectors scratching their heads. While most folk don't hold it against them *now,* it's still odd a lot of the information they never disclosed. In terms of marketing, it would help if they were more honest about their grading options. "We Grade Everything" is pretty embarassing when you learn they don't. Similarly, prominent and public figures in the market have questionable role in the market (e.g., saying they are big collectors but are only in it for the money).
3. VGA has several issues as well:

   * No end in sight for catching up on its backlog. They supposedly doubled their operational capacity, but have admitted on social media they've been unable to fill openings for new graders. Meanwhile, their top two tiers are more expensive than ever and dedicate 1/2 their working time just to the backlog.
   * Unkept promises. For 10 years we've been promised a new website and submission experience with population reports. During the summer of 2021, off the criticisms against Wata brought about by Karl Jobst, VGA intelligently announced their backlog would be caught up by end of year and new website released shortly after (including pop reports!). It's now August 2022, and only one of these promises has been delivered purely by technicality (again, new website with no features). It's clear their move was a PR stunt to gain market confidence. Sadly now it has had the opposite effect.
   * Their highest tiers (their only tiers, actually) are at a minimum 5 months for turn-around time, meanwhile Wata is delivering its lowest tier to customers at 3x the speed.
   * They continually dwindle their offerings online. Lack of pop reports is nothing new, but not having any visibility into them for this long is troubling. Similarly, they have no option to make a submission through the website. Wata's submission experience is currently the standard by a long shot (and is admittedly a good one!)
   * The current submission option (filling out a lengthy form) is fairly broken. It feels like I'm doing my taxes.
   * Outdated transparency on grade methodology. With Wata grading box and seal separately, and VGA grading VHS in the same way, it feels like high time video games got the same treatment.
4. We're probably kidding ourselves if we think the active market for graded games is large right now. There's been more visibility brought in due to the pandemic and high value auctions taking place in the past couple years, but the overall buyer pool is still relatively small. In my opinion, it's probably in the three to low four figure range still.
5. General lack of honoring customers (accountability). At the end of the day, these grading companies are corporations with legal counsel seeking to protect their reputation and bottom line. If your game is damaged, lost, or mishandled in some way, it's in their best interest to pay out as little as possible or avoid liability altogether (this means if you put in X for your insurance value, they will gladly pay that out even if the fair market value is far higher). I say this as a separate complaint because companies like Wata have often advertised that they're doing hard work to protect and preserve your "precious collectables," but don't always show that when it comes time to do right by customers. Similarly, VGA often gives radio silence when raising issues like reporting reproduction games graded as authentic.

The above list is based on my personal experiences and observations, having been in the hobby for a short 2 and 1/2 years.

As the above criticisms might seem harsh, I want to self-counter a bit by saying the graded market has a bright future ahead if Wata can continue to improve with its newly-acquired larger resources in Collector's Universe, VGA can catch up in terms of customer experience and data transparency (read: pop reports), and CGC can deliver a solid product sufficient to kick the other two into gear.

Sadly, if CGC fails to deliver, and Wata and VGA continue to instill low confidence in their products and services, the hobby may become stale and lose participants.

In terms of things happening *right now* though, Wata is finally delivering its population reports, has opened more consoles whose games they can grade (all modern!), and VGA just recently updated to its 10 year awaited new website. Some movement is always promising, even if it's not the full picture yet (no seal grades for Wata's pop report and VGA doesn't have much happening on the new site).

What I recommend to new and even veteran collectors in the graded space hasn't changed much in the last year or so: collect what you enjoy. Nothing beats the feeling of a purchase that you know you won't regret 5 years down the line!
