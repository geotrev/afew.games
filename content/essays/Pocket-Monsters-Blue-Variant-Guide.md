title: Pocket Monsters Blue Variant Guide
description: Print variations for Pokemon's third series entry
---

Greetings friends! This post is a researched guide on the various components & print combinations of Pocket Monsters Ao (Blue version). As time goes on, I will update it as new information is presented & discussed in the collecting community. In our previous posts, we looked at [Pocket Monsters Red and Green](https://www.afew.games/essays/pocket-monsters-red-green-variant-guide), including a dedicated post to the [very first editions](https://www.afew.games/essays/pocket-monsters-red-green-early-print-breakdown).

NOTE: To see the list of print variants as they exist on A Few Games' database, [view them here](https://www.afew.games). A full list of sources can be found at the end of this post.

## Overview

Pocket Monsters Blue is a curious case in the history of the franchise. To start, it had multiple printings of seemingly the same contents and box, and was only available through mail order. Later, it would finally get its own retail release, but only after Yellow version launched.

It's also worth noting that Pocket Monsters Blue's software version would go on to be the basis for international releases, Pokemon Red and Pokemon Blue.

Here's a high level timeline of public availability for the game:

1. ***CoroCoro Comic* Mail Order Campaign (December 1996):** To celebrate 1 million sales of Red and Green versions, customers could order the limited release *Blue* version.
2. ***TOYOTA* Campaign (1997):** Distributed for customers who signed on to a *Toyota* contract.
3. ***Lawson* mail order campaign (July 1997):** Customers can once again apply & receive *Blue* via online application.
4. **General retail release (Oct. 10th, 1999):** Finally, customers can buy Blue version in stores.

## 1996 CoroCoro Comic Mail-Order Campaign

Blue version was [announced](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Blue_Version_\(Japanese\)) on October 15th, 1996, then [featured in CoroCoro Comic](https://lavacutcontent.com/corocoro-comic-pokemon-blue/) where readers were informed they could purchase & receive the game by mail. To date, Blue version is the only made-to-order entry ever made. It's unclear exactly how many copies were produced.
