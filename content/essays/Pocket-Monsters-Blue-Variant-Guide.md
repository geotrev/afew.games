title: Pocket Monsters Blue Variant Guide
description: Print variations for Pokemon's third series entry
---

Greetings friends! This post is a researched guide on the various components & print combinations of Pocket Monsters Ao (Blue version). As time goes on, I will update it as new information is presented & discussed in the collecting community. In our previous posts, we looked at [Pocket Monsters Red and Green](https://www.afew.games/essays/pocket-monsters-red-green-variant-guide), including a dedicated post to the [very first editions](https://www.afew.games/essays/pocket-monsters-red-green-early-print-breakdown).

***NOTE:** To see the list of print variants as they exist on A Few Games' database, [view them here](https://www.afew.games). A full list of sources can be found at the end of this post.*

## Overview

Pocket Monsters Blue is a curious case in the history of the franchise. To start, it had multiple printings of seemingly the same contents and box, and was only available through mail order. Later, it would finally get its own retail release, but only after Yellow version launched.

It's also worth noting that Pocket Monsters Blue's software version would go on to be the basis for international releases, Pokemon Red and Pokemon Blue.

Here's a high level timeline of public availability for the game:

1. ***CoroCoro Comic* Mail Order Campaign (December 1996):** To celebrate 1 million sales of Red and Green versions, customers could order the limited release *Blue* version.
2. ***TOYOTA* Campaign (1997):** Distributed for customers who signed on to a *Toyota* contract.
3. ***Lawson* mail order campaign (July 1997):** Customers can once again apply & receive *Blue* via online application.
4. **General retail release (Oct. 10th, 1999):** Finally, customers can buy Blue version in stores.

### 1996 CoroCoro Comic Mail-Order Campaign

Blue version was [announced](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Blue_Version_\(Japanese\)) on October 15th, 1996, then [featured in CoroCoro Comic](https://lavacutcontent.com/corocoro-comic-pokemon-blue/) where readers were informed they could purchase & receive the game by mail. To date, Blue version is the only made-to-order entry ever made. It's unclear exactly how many copies were produced.

\*CoroCoro \*readers could expect to receive their copy of *Pocket Monsters Blue* in mid-December of that year, at the earliest, and orders after November would likely arrive by January or February in the new year.

This initial version included a plastic bag. The application period was October 15th through December 27th, 1996, to celebrate one million sales for *Red* and *Green*.

### TOYOTA Campaign

*Blue* had an exclusive *TOYOTA AUTO* promotion that features a sticker. The box doesn't appear to have any different characteristics compared to the mail order variant.

According to collector @RB1989421GB on X/*Twitter* (roughly translated):

> The Toyota version was distributed as a commemorative gift to those who signed a contract during the Toyota campaign period in 1997, as a set of Toyota limited model *Game Boy Pocket Skeleton & Pokemon Blue Version*. There is a Toyota Auto **sticker** on the box.

### 1997 Lawson Mail Order Campaign

Between June and August in 1997, a second mail order campaign took place for customers who missed the late-1996 campaign in *Corocoro Comic*. This time the applications were available in *CoroCoro Comic*, *Ciao*, **and** *Lawson* Magazines.

An Internet Archive page from *Game Freak*'s website, roughly translated, says:

> There's another chance to get your hands on "Pokemon Blue Version."Â This time, to commemorate the sales of over 4 million copies, the blue version is being sold online as a special project jointly carried out by Nintendo, Shogakukan, and convenience store Lawson.\
> \
> The mail order period is from June 13th to August 31st. For details on mail order applications, please check Shogakukan's grade magazines, magazines such as CoroCoro Comic, Ciao, or Lawson.

### 1999 Retail Release

According to @RB1989421GB on *X/Twitter*, the retail version released on October 10th, 1999 (almost three years after the mail order version).

While the mail order variant had no barcode on the actual box (see above photos), the retail release included it:

## Contents

### Cartridge

There are currently known launch copies using `20` production codes.

![Blue cartridge with '20' stamp code](/uploads/blue-20-cart.png)

There are likely parallel codes used at launch, but that's still unclear.

When looking at the circuit board for the above cartridge, the date code (`9646`) is a few weeks before the December release date, indicating its a first, or at least very early production copy.

Here is the reference to those cartridge production codes:

*Note: The second "green" in the table is actually* Blue *version. ðŸ˜‰*

#### Matching Paperwork

The below information was determined by a thorough survey of listing data on *eBay*, *Mercari* (Japanese), and *Yahoo! Auction Japan*.

Early editions of *Blue* likely had minimal contents, and possibly no ad inserts. The game at least had the following:

* Manual (`JPN` code)
* Map
* Anti-tampering warning

While unconfirmed for now, if ads were included in the 1996-1997 versions, it would have been this *Game Boy Pocket* ad, which also appeared in *Red* and *Green* versions at the time:

Later versions would include multiple ads, especially retail copies:

* Manual (`JPN-1`)
* Game Boy Color ad (`CGB001-JPN-2`)
* Game Boy Camera ad (`MGB006-JPN`)
* Pocket Monsters Stadium ad (`APSJ-JPN`)

Each piece of hardware advertised was released at the time and are consistent in numerous listed samples on websites like *Yahoo! Auction Japan*, *Mercari*, and the like. Sibling games *Red*, *Green*, and *Yellow* also contained the same ads at this time:

## Conclusion

What did you think of this scroll down history lane? Like all the other guides I post, I try to fill as many blanks as I can, but unfortunately sometimes certain details are lost to time. With unopened copies of these games now selling for four- and five-figures, it can be challenging to definitively get to the bottom of this info short of a full set of manufacturing order sheets.

If you know anything that might add to the thoroughness of this guide, feel free to reach out!
