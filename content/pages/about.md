  - content: "A Few Games started as a simple blog & collection website. I enjoyed the\r idea of sharing my game collection, but quickly after building the initial version, I wanted to share my (at the time) private database of video game\r print data, not just the specific games I own.\n\nFast forward to today, the site has switched to a public & open source database, but with a secondary blog component. My passion is still to\r share the interesting & enjoyable history of physical video games.\n\nIn other words, I want to answer questions like: What is the chronology of\r a given game's printing? What signifiers do publishers exercise when revising games? How scarce are these different print variants?\n\nFinally, where do you, the reader/contributor, fit into this? As mentioned above, the database is fully open source. You can view both the raw data\r and code at the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/geotrev/afew.games). I aim to facilitate an environment where folks can help build a free, accessible, and transparent resource,\r\ntogether.\n\nThanks for reading and I hope to see you around!\n\n***\n\n***PS:** Do you want to see the games I own? I have an [Instagram ](https://instagram.com/a.few.games)for that! I'd love to see your games too. Thanks if you decide to give a follow. On a related note, sign up for occasional emails with updates on new blog posts and database additions. I promise not to spam you. ;)*\n"
