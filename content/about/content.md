  A Few Games started as a simple blog & collection website. I enjoyed the
  idea of sharing my game collection, but quickly after building the initial
  version, I wanted to share my (at the time) private database of video game
  print data, not just the specific games I own.


  Fast forward to today, the site has switched to a public & open source
  database, but with a secondary blog component. My passion is still to
  share the interesting & enjoyable history of physical video games.


  In other words, I want to answer questions like: What is the chronology of
  a given game's printing? What signifiers do publishers exercise when
  revising games? How scarce are these different print variants?


  Finally, where do you, the reader/contributor, fit into this? As mentioned
  above, the database is fully open source. You can view both the raw data
  and code at the GitHub repository. I aim to facilitate an environment
  where folks can help build a free, accessible, and transparent resource,
  together.


  Thanks for reading and I hope to see you around!

  PS: Do you want to see the games I own? I have an Instagram for that! I'd
  love to see your games too. Thanks if you decide to give a follow. On a
  related note, sign up for occasional emails with updates on new blog posts
  and database additions. I promise not to spam you. ;)
