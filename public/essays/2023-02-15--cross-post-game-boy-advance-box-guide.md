description: An overview of box variants for Nintendo's final Game Boy iteration
---
Everyone has a game system they played more than any other. For me, that's easily GBA (Game Boy Advance). While it's easily one of the simplest in terms of identifying variants, you get the benefit of straightforward, unambiguous collecting (with a few rare exceptions, as all third party games can have).

Today, Wata posted an article I wrote discussing the three main box types for GBA games. [Give the article a read](https://blog.watagames.com/2023/02/14/game-boy-advance-box-guide/) if you have 5-10 minutes.

I learned a cool a cool thing while writing this, particularly just how rare the Wata-named cross-fold boxes are. I guess I shouldn't be surprised there are only **a whopping four unique games** they've seen, which explains why I've never personally collected or played a game that shipped in one of those boxes. I'd previously only seen it for *[Spyro Orange: The Cortex Conspiracy](https://spyro.fandom.com/wiki/Spyro_Orange:_The_Cortex_Conspiracy)*.

A follow-up to this that I'd like to explore is finding a substantive list of some games that were printed across varying box types. Fun fact, I learned today from [BirdDogGaming](https://www.youtube.com/@birddoggaming) that the above *Spyro* was in print for so long it shipped with *all three* box types. Crazy times in the early-mid 2000s.

Thanks for reading!
