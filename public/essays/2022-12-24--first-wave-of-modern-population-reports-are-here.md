title: First Wave of Modern Population Reports Are Here!
description: An analysis of GameCube, Xbox, and PlayStation 2 population data
---
If you're in the graded game space, you're likely well familiar with how long pop reports have taken to be released to the public. VGA's pop reports are nowhere to be seen and Wata had only previously released generations 1-5 (e.g., only vintage).

Thankfully Christmas came early this year with 13 new mid-generation (6-7) console population reports! For pre-nintendo collectors, there's also Atari, Intellivision, and Colecovision populations to peruse as well.

For now, I wanted to gather some data on a handful of the earliest modern consoles available, including GameCube, Xbox, and PS2. There's some interesting, and perhaps unsurprising info to see.

As a caveat to the below data, remember: games submitted to Wata won't and will never be able to represent the wider collecting hobby. This is mainly due to the fact that graded games and its community of enthusiasts is still very small when compared to the larger collecting sphere, and the motivations of grading are at least partially skewed by the highest value and/or sought-after games.

Same as in previous essays, we'll break down each console into a few metrics:

* Seal grade totals
* Box grade totals (new!)
* Seal grade breakdown across each box grade, starting at 9.0
* The top 10 submitted games

## GameCube

Not surprisingly, seal grades for GameCube skew to A+, with a surprisingly low number of A++ (just 4%!)

| Seal Grade | Total | %      |
| ---------- | ----- | ------ |
| A++        | 213   | 5.68%  |
| A+         | 1706  | 45.51% |
| A          | 1401  | 37.37% |
| B+         | 358   | 9.55%  |
| B          | 64    | 1.71%  |
| C+         | 6     | 0.16%  |
| C          | 1     | 0.03%  |
| Total      | 3749  | 100%  |

With box grades, the numbers are equally revealing as they show a heavy skew in 9.6 and up. Basically, this means if you're after a grade that meets a condition minimum equal to or better than most people, you'll want *at least* 9.6 A+.

| Box Grade | Total | %   |
| --------- | ----- | --- |
| 9.0       | 198   | 5.51%    |
| 9.2       | 474   | 13.19%    |
| 9.4       | 1251  | 34.81%    |
| 9.6       | 1371  | 38.15%    |
| 9.8       | 300   | 8.35%    |
| 10       | 0   | 0%    |
| Total     | 3594| 100%    |
