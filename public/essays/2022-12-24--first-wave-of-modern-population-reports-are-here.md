title: First Wave of Modern Population Reports Are Here!
description: An analysis of Nintendo GameCube graded population data
---
If you're in the graded game space, you're likely well familiar with how long pop reports have taken to be released to the public. VGA's pop reports are nowhere to be seen and Wata had only previously released generations 1-5 (e.g., only vintage).

Thankfully Christmas came early this year with six new mid-generation (6-7) console populations! Included in the update is seven additional vintage consoles, including Atari, Intellivision, and Colecovision populations to peruse as well.

For now, I wanted to gather some data and focus briefly on GameCube. There's some interesting, and perhaps unsurprising info to see.

Stay tuned for Xbox and PS2 in the near future.

As a caveat to the below data, remember: games submitted to Wata won't and will never be able to represent the wider collecting hobby. This is mainly due to the fact that graded games and its community(ies) of enthusiasts are still very small when compared to the larger collecting sphere. The motivations of grading are at least partially skewed by the highest value and/or sought-after games too.

Same as in previous essays, we'll break down each console into a few metrics:

* Seal grade totals
* Box grade totals (new!)
* Seal grade breakdown across each box grade, starting at 9.0
* The top 10 submitted games

## GameCube

Not surprisingly, seal grades for GameCube skew to A+, with a surprisingly low number of A++; under the likes of NES, which precedes GameCube by 20+ years.

| Seal Grade | Total | %      |
| ---------- | ----- | ------ |
| A++        | 213   | 5.68%  |
| A+         | 1706  | 45.51% |
| A          | 1401  | 37.37% |
| B+         | 358   | 9.55%  |
| B          | 64    | 1.71%  |
| C+         | 6     | 0.16%  |
| C          | 1     | 0.03%  |
| Total      | 3749  | 100%   |

With box grades, the numbers are equally revealing as they show a heavy skew in 9.6 and up. Basically, this means if you're after a grade that meets a condition minimum equal to or better than most graded copies, you'll want *at least* 9.4 A+.

| Box Grade | Total | %      |
| --------- | ----- | ------ |
| 9.0       | 198   | 5.51%  |
| 9.2       | 474   | 13.19% |
| 9.4       | 1251  | 34.81% |
| 9.6       | 1371  | 38.15% |
| 9.8       | 300   | 8.35%  |
| 10        | 0     | 0%     |
| Total     | 3594  | 100%   |

Box grades from 9.0 and up spread as you would expect across seal grades:

| Box Grade         | A++   | A+     | A      | B+    | B     | C+    | C     | NS    |
| ----------------- | ----- | ------ | ------ | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 10                | 0     | 0      | 0      | 0     | 0     | 0     | 0     | 0     |
| 9.8               | 71    | 189    | 40     | 0     | 0     | 0     | 0     | 0     |
| 9.6               | 102   | 806    | 423    | 37    | 3     | 0     | 0     | 0     |
| 9.4               | 22    | 527    | 567    | 122   | 13    | 0     | 0     | 0     |
| 9.2               | 13    | 130    | 234    | 83    | 13    | 1     | 0     | 0     |
| 9                 | 4     | 36     | 89     | 56    | 13    | 0     | 0     | 0     |
| Seal Total        | 212   | 1688   | 1353   | 298   | 42    | 1     | 0     | 0     |
| % of Total Graded | 5.65% | 45.03% | 36.09% | 7.95% | 1.12% | 0.03% | 0.00% | 0.00% |

These might be somewhat shocking figures, but **98.87% scored 9.0 or higher** and **45% of all games submitted are at least 9.0 A+**. As mentioned earlier, to be **above the weighted average** for GameCube, you'll want 9.4 A+ or better.

Real quick, let's talk about seal grades. Why so few A++? One theory could be that the seals were produced with a very cheap material and therefore are susceptible to scratches and tearing. Regardless of the reason, A++ seals are clearly rare, so hold onto those!

Here's the top 10 most graded games on GameCube

Not surprisingly, the top five comprise the top selling franchises of Nintendo: Mario and Zelda. As for some intriguing figures:

* Wind Waker has 9 Made in Japan examples graded, one 9.8 A+, and only two 9.6 A+.
* Wind Waker 130 Made in USA examples graded, one 9.8 A++, three 9.8 A+, one 9.6 A++, and \*\*twenty\*\* 9.6 A+ graded.
* Super Smash Bros Melee (SSBM) has 13 Made in Japan (standard retail) examples graded. There is one 9.8 A+ and two 9.6 A+.
* SSBM has only five Made in Japan NFR examples graded (this was part of the 2002 console pack-in). The highest graded is 9.6 A+ with two examples.
* SSBM has 23 Made in USA examples graded. There is one of 9.8 A++ and 9.6 A++, each, and three 9.6 A+.
* Mario Kart Double Dash (MKDD) has only 4 Made in Japan retail prints graded, three of which are 9.6 A at the highest end.
* MKDD has a sparse two total copies of its Made In USA Bonus Disc (standard retail) variant graded (53155A part code). 
* MKDD also has 39 examples of its NFR variant with part code 56043A, with one 9.8 A++, two 9.8 A+, and eight 9.6 A+ examples.
* Metroid Prime has all of 10 Made in Japan examples, the highest of which is 9.6 A+ with just one example.
* Metroid Prime's standard Made in USA retail print has 43 copies graded, with one 9.8 A++, three 9.8 A+, one 9.6 A++, and seven 9.6 A+ examples.
* Metroid Prime has ZERO Target Exclusive variants (49830A code) graded.
