When you received your first copy of Pokemon, where were you? Some folks got it as a Christmas present or at the store, in its physical sealed box. Some folks received just a cartridge.

What makes these experiences unique isn't only the momentary snapshot in our personal lives when we first experienced the games, but also the actual version of the game we received.

This shouldn't be new to anyone, but it's worth clarifying: if you are familiar with software, you know that it needs to occasionally be updated for new features and bug fixes. Video games, even in their static physical form, are no different. Given physical games can't really be updated by consumers, the next step is for a game developer to push out a new *physical version* of the game in the form of a print run.

What this post aims to do is shed light on the known print variations of Pocket Monsters: Green & Red, starting from their initial release, up through final printings.

## Early Release

The initial release of Green and Red version had some unique differences, both on the box and the inserts. For the purposes of this post, green version will be the primary reference as the same information applies to both, however exceptions or missing information will be noted as appropriate.

### Box

The main point to draw attention to is the barcode on the back. Early versions of at least Green version had a larger barcode.

For comparison, a first print Green:

Compared to subsequent printings:

Unfortunately, not enough evidence exists to suggest Red version also had a large barcode for its first printing.

## Contents

Next, let's draw attention to the inside of the box. Almost every piece is important to determine a proper first production copy.

### Cartridge

A Red or Green cartridge from the true first (or early) printings of the game will have either no code at all, or a strictly numerical code stamped onto the cartridge sticker. Here is an example of a mid- to late-production cartridge with the code `20A`:

Here's a translated reference on which codes are likely to be found on the earliest copies of Red, Green, Blue, and Yellow versions:

## Inserts

The next important indicator is the earliest printings have the following:

* Initial release survey insert
* Super Game Boy ad

### Survey

The initial release survey was included for the very first round of the games at retail.

It translates to roughly the following:

> Kyoto City Higashiyama Post Office P.O. Box No. 15
>
> Thank you for purchasing Pocket Monsters. Sorry to trouble you, we request your opinion as valuable reference for future software in this questionnaire.
>
> A lottery will be run for those who participate to receive:
>
> * Pokemon Guidebook (issued to 100 people)
> * We will present Special Playing Cards (issued to 500 people)
>
> In addition, the announcement of the winner will receive a free copy. This is valid until the end of March 1996.

Given the game released in February of that year,
