title: On Video Game Condition in the Secondary Market
description: Condition used to, and continues to, dominate the highest end of

A common topic that comes up among game collectors is, "why did that game sell for so much?" Usually in response to a graded or a very nice looking complete-in-box (CIB) game. It's a topic so densely beaten into the ground that it's become odd how much it comes up - you'd think more people would understand and have access to learning this aspect of the collectibles market by now!

In this essay, let's break down the nuances of this market facet. We'll cover topics like:

* What, why, and how games trend up with condition
* Why graded games suffer the biggest punches on this topic
* Where the market is likely to go over the next five to 10 years

## Trends & Economics

The most basic way you can approach understanding video game price trends is having some foundational knowledge of economics: supply and demand.

Can you remember The Great Toilet Paper Shortage of 2020? The COVID-19 pandemic had just started, and droves of consumers went to stores to stock up on essentials so they could hunker down and stall out the collective collapse of society. It was a scary time! And as it usually happens, one of the major supplies affected was toilet paper.

It got so bad in fact, in my town in Oregon at least, that all stores had mandatory "Seniors-only Tuesday Shopping" so the elderly could collect their food.

So can you guess what happened? Well, people listed their toilet paper on eBay for $100s. The same happened with hand sanitizer, and eventually, N95 masks.

This is just one example, but it happens all the time in all sorts of sectors. Baby formula is another one that happened over the last year. Ultimately, video games can and will suffer the same fate as toilet paper and baby formula, occasionally.

### Don't touch

Let's take it back to video games, though. Often the *raw supply* of most any game will be in the thousands. Very few games simply aren't in ready supply; you could probably name a few easily.

So why do some games, seemingly common and sold in the millions, sell for high prices?

Often, it's simply condition.

Most games have been opened, mangled, and sometimes destroyed and trashed. That makes well-preserved and even sealed games highly coveted, and as a result, valuable.

### Emotion Often Wins

But wait, surely something else would make games more valuable, right? Often it's as simple as nostalgia (and in my experience, that's generally true for pop culture collectibles). You've probably played some games for *hours* and as a result have very strong positive-chemical reactions to them. I know because I'm also (allegedly) only human.

Simply put, the emotional buyer will spend more to get their childhood favorite.

## Grading & Authentication

As much as the larger game collecting community wants to disavow grading, it continues only to grow in usage. Time only moves forward, and with it, knowledge about what makes a game truly "authentic" gets lost. That's why I write on this very blog - to help you learn things you might not know!

But authentication aside, the more important feature of grading is the condition factor (you know, the *grade*) itself.

I've frequently read and heard arguments against grading like...

* I have eyes, I can see the condition myself.
* Why trust a third party? What gives them the authority?
* They'll grade too high to inflate price.
* They'll grade a *fake game*! They clearly don't know what they're doing.

And on and on.

But here's the reality: a game grader like Wata or VGA only has a stake in a game's value insofar as it enables auction houses and ebay sellers to sell more of their games and increase the grader's market share, resulting in higher demand with some organic consumer interest. That's how all business works, it's nothing new.

Admittedly, Wata and even VGA have been accused of manipulating the market by propping their own products with auction houses and sellers, to the extent that there's been numerous youtube videos covering the subject. 

Ultimately, no market is made in a vaccuum. Ethics will be stretched in capitalism; it's everywhere. Removing your emotions from the analysis can only help you in this scenario, because then you'll see there's might actually be something to this graded stuff once you acknowledge just how rare high grade CIB and sealed games really are.

### For Lack of a Better Option

Look, I'm not saying graders are the best option we could have asked for. Far from it, in fact; clearly the financial position and interests of a for-profit institution adds a layer of concern that not even the most ingrained graded game collector can ignore.

But with that said, there simply hasn't been motivation for another market participant to enter and give this imaginary hope to collectors everywhere.

Instead, we have the options we have: Wata, VGA, and CGC.

### Buyer Confidence & Lowest Cost Risk

The biggest argument for a graded game to a collector is simply that it adds a third party opinion, with standard and consistent analysis practices, to the games encased in a holder. The result is bidders and buyers everywhere can generally know what to expect when buying, and no longer need to buy multiples to get the condition range that they want.

There's always a learning curve to understanding a grade scale, though, but that's far better (and cheaper) to acquaint than spending potentially hundreds of dollars in order to get a game in the condition that suits your needs.

But this third party opinion is actually very important: it removes the seller's need to inflate condition with arbitrary descriptions like "near mint." You've probably seen it and experienced it. What does near mint mean to eBay user "cool_games_69"? Probably not what it means to you!

And herein lays the key: this general confidence in a grade can lead to huge boosts in prices because now there isn't guesswork involved. It either is or isn't in the range of a 90 (VGA), or 9.4 A++ (Wata/CGC), but given the operation is methodical and practiced, you can rely on your understanding of a given grade to know exactly what you're expecting, including a possible risk of over-grading.

### Condition Inaccuracies

Like all services and products, grading isn't perfect. Collectors should and often do know that. While I collect graded games on my own, I still want to see pictures of the dang thing just to double check.

This distinction is crucial though: I wouldn't re-evaluate a game top-to-bottom like I would an ungraded game. I'm simply checking that there aren't any clear red flags that a given grade might have snuck through a bit too high for my liking.

Ultimately, grades are ranges and we need to treat them as such. There isn't and likely won't ever be a simple, clear, and unambiguous way to definitely say X condition will always mean Y descriptor, accounting for all flaws. It just won't happen, and that's key for any collector to understand before they put money in a hobby like this.
