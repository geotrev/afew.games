title: On Video Game Condition in the Secondary Market
description: Condition used to, and continues to, dominate the highest end of
  resold video games
---
A common topic that comes up among game collectors is, "why did that game sell for so much?" Usually in response to a graded or a very nice looking complete-in-box (CIB) game. It's a topic so densely beaten into the ground that it's become odd how much it comes up - you'd think more people would understand and have access to learning this aspect of the collectibles market by now!

Disclaimer: the following essay is my own opinion. I base my views on my time collecting games over the last 5-10 years.

In this essay, let's break down the nuances of this market facet. We'll cover topics like:

* What, why, and how games trend up with condition
* Why graded games suffer the biggest punches on this topic
* Where the market is likely to go over the next five to 10 years

## Trends & Economics

The most basic way you can approach understanding video game price trends is having some foundational knowledge of economics: supply and demand.

Can you remember The Great Toilet Paper Shortage of 2020? The COVID-19 pandemic had just started, and droves of consumers went to stores to stock up on essentials so they could hunker down and stall out the collective collapse of society. It was a scary time! And as it usually happens, one of the major supplies affected was toilet paper.

It got so bad in fact, in my town in Oregon at least, that all stores had mandatory "Seniors-only Tuesday Shopping" so the elderly could collect their food.

So can you guess what happened? Well, people listed their toilet paper on eBay for $100s. The same happened with hand sanitizer, and eventually, N95 masks.

This is just one example, but it happens all the time in all sorts of sectors. Baby formula is another one that happened over the last year. Ultimately, video games can and will suffer the same fate as toilet paper and baby formula, occasionally.

### Don't Touch the Goods

Let's take it back to video games, though. Often the *raw supply* of most any game will be in the thousands. Very few games simply aren't in ready supply; you could probably name a few easily.

So why do some games, seemingly common and sold in the millions, sell for high prices?

Often, it's simply condition. There's a reason why most near mint, CIB copies of Mega Man X sell for somewhere between $200-350, but when a single [dead mint copy](https://www.ebay.com/itm/175579956100) appears on the scene, it sells for over four times the highest end of [past sales](https://www.pricecharting.com/game/super-nintendo/mega-man-x#completed-auctions-cib).

Most games have been opened, mangled, and sometimes destroyed and trashed. That makes well-preserved and even sealed games highly coveted, and as a result, valuable.

### Emotion Often Wins

But wait, surely something else would make games more valuable, right? Often it's as simple as nostalgia (and in my experience, that's generally true for pop culture collectibles). You've probably played some games for *hours* and as a result have very strong positive-chemical reactions to them. I know because I'm also (allegedly) only human.

Simply put, the emotional buyer will spend more to get their childhood favorite.

## Grading & Authentication

As much as the larger game collecting community wants to disavow grading, it continues only to grow in usage. Time only moves forward, and with it, knowledge about what makes a game truly "authentic" gets lost. That's why I write on this very blog - to help you learn things you might not know!

But authentication aside, the more important feature of grading is the condition factor (you know, the *grade*) itself.

I've frequently read and heard arguments against grading like...

* I have eyes, I can see the condition myself.
* Why trust a third party? What gives them the authority?
* They'll grade too high to inflate price.
* They'll grade a *fake game*! They clearly don't know what they're doing.

And on and on.

But here's the reality: a game grader like Wata or VGA only has a stake in a game's value insofar as it enables auction houses and ebay sellers to sell more of their games and increase the grader's market share, resulting in higher demand with some organic consumer interest. That's how all business works, it's nothing new.

Admittedly, Wata and even VGA have been accused of manipulating the market by propping their own products with auction houses and sellers, to the extent that there's been [numerous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvLFEh7V18A) [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKbuNwS-gaI) [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Z2WQqJkISM) covering the subject. 

Ultimately, no market is made in a vacuum. Ethics will be stretched in capitalism; it's everywhere. Removing your emotions from the analysis can only help you in this scenario, because then you'll see there's might actually be something to this graded stuff once you acknowledge just how rare high grade CIB and sealed games really are.

### For Lack of a Better Option

Look, I'm not saying graders are the best option we could have asked for. Far from it, in fact; clearly the financial position and interests of a for-profit institution adds a layer of concern that not even the most ingrained graded game collector ignores.

That said, there simply hasn't been motivation for another style of market participant, so this imaginary hope to a total unbiased, uncompromising third party might not be realistic.

Instead, we have the options we have: Wata, VGA, and CGC. They do their job well and deliver a great product. You can generally trust the grades, and the knowledge in the hobby about authenticity keeps confidence relatively stable.

### Buyer Confidence & Lowest Cost Risk

The biggest argument for a graded game to a collector is simply that it adds a separate, third party opinion, with standard and consistent analysis practices. The result is bidders and buyers everywhere can generally know what to expect when buying and no longer need to buy multiples to get the condition range that they want.

There's always a learning curve to understanding a grade scale, though, but that's far better (and cheaper) to acquaint than spending potentially hundreds of dollars in order to get a game in the condition that suits your needs.

But this third party opinion is actually very important: it removes the seller's need to inflate condition with arbitrary descriptions like "near mint." You've probably seen it and experienced it. What does near mint mean to eBay user "cool_games_69"? Probably not what it means to you!

And herein lays the key: this general confidence in a grade can lead to huge boosts in prices because now there isn't guesswork involved. It either is or isn't in the range of a 90 (VGA), or 9.4 A++ (Wata/CGC), but given the operation is methodical and practiced, you can rely on your understanding of a given grade to know exactly what you're expecting, including a possible risk of over-grading.

### Condition Inaccuracies

Like all services and products, grading isn't perfect. Collectors should and often do know that. While I collect graded games on my own, I still want to see pictures of the dang thing just to double check.

This distinction is crucial though: I wouldn't re-evaluate a game top-to-bottom like I would an ungraded game. I'm simply checking that there aren't any clear red flags that a given grade might have snuck through a bit too high for my liking.

Ultimately, grades are ranges and we need to treat them as such. There isn't and likely won't ever be a simple, clear, and unambiguous way to definitely say X condition will always mean Y descriptor, accounting for all flaws. It just won't happen, and that's key for any collector to understand before they put money in a hobby like this.

## Market Interest & the Future

Let's bring it back the discussion to condition. Given the above context on grading, collectors, and motivations of collectors, where does that leave us with the market?

Truthfully, it's hard to say. Currently a significant portion of collectors still view grading and condition rarity as a major niche. In all fairness to these folks, it's absolutely true. Where I start to disagree is the downstream argument of, "it's not currently popular, so obviously it has no future."

It's no coincidence this discussion includes grading. Again, it provides the third party, unbiased (from the buyer's point of view) opinion that prevents sellers from embellishing condition. In that sense, it should go without saying that condition-based collecting is likely to be more popular as grading services continue to expand.

There's also the factor of community involvement. I see new collectors hopping into condition collecting (with grading or otherwise) almost daily. As niche as the market is, it's quite stable and steadily growing to encompass more diverse views and collections.

So, sure, the hobby is niche and perhaps is unpopular when taken from a larger scope, but surely if Pokemon cards and comics can reach their current level of popularity, then so can video games, as they follow most of the same attributes.

This is ultimately just my opinion, but signs point to continued interest, and to me that means growth.

## Conclusion

Much like other financial markets, antiques, and collectibles, discussions about video game collecting trends, interest, and analyzing condition-motivated interest is ultimately a topic of psychology. I find it all interesting because there *is* a clear trend at work that shows people want the nicest examples of old and even new games.
