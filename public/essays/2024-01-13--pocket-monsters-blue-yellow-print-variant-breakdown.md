description: A visual guide to the next two entries in the first generation of Pokemon
---
This is the second part of a series all about Pocket Monsters print variants, as a follow up to the previous [post](https://www.afew.games/essays/pocket-monsters-red-green-early-print-breakdown) which focused on the early prints of *Red* & *Green* versions.

*This post is supplemental to the database. To see a list of first generation* Pocket Monsters *print variants as they exist on A Few Games, [view them here](https://www.afew.games/?search=pocket+monsters&platform=game+boy). A full list of sources can be found at the end of this post.*

## Pocket Monsters: Blue

*Blue* version is unique for a few reasons. First, it started the first of a "sealed bag" treatment that would continue through *Crystal* version. It also was the first and only game to have a mail order launch before hitting retail proper.

### Mail Order Release

*Blue* version was [announced on October 15th, 1996](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Blue_Version_(Japanese)), then [featured in CoroCoro Comic](https://lavacutcontent.com/corocoro-comic-pokemon-blue/) where readers were informed they could purchase & receive the game by mail. In this model, *Blue* verison was the only made-to-order entry ever made. It's unclear exactly how many copies were produced for the campaign.

*CoroCoro Comic magazine spread, with application and instructions to receive* Blue *version*

*CoroCoro* readers could expect to receive their copy of *Pocket Monsters Blue* in mid-December of that year, at the earliest, and orders after November would likely arrive by January or February in the new year.

This initial version included a plastic bag. The application period was October 15th through December 27th, 1996, to celebrate one million sales for *Red* and *Green*.

According to @RB1989421GB on *X/Twitter*, the retail version was supposedly only made available after *Yellow* version released, on October 10, 1999 (almost three years after the mail order version).

While the mail order variant had no barcode on the actual box (see above photos), the retail release included it:

In 1997, two more events occurred to get *Blue* in customers' hands.

### TOYOTA Campaign

*Blue* had an exclusive *TOYOTA AUTO* promotion that features a sticker. The box doesn't appear to have any different characteristics compared to the mail order variant.

According to @RB1989421GB on X/*Twitter* (translated roughly):

> The Toyota version was distributed as a commemorative gift to those who signed a contract during the Toyota campaign period in 1997, as a set of Toyota limited model *Game Boy Pocket Skeleton & Pokemon Blue Version*. There is a Toyota Auto **sticker** on the box.

### 1997 Lawson Mail Order Campaign

Between June and August in 1997, a second mail order campaign took place for customers who missed the late-1996 campaign in *Corocoro Comic*. This time the applications were available in *CoroCoro Comic*, *Ciao*, and *Lawson* Magazines.

Nothing about this campaign indicates the game had print differences from its previous two campaigns, but new information may reveal differently. For instance, there's a possibility for either *Game Boy Pocket* or very early *Game Boy Camera* ads were included.

From *Game Freak*'s website (roughly translated, source at the end of this post):

> There's another chance to get your hands on "Pokemon Blue Version." This time, to commemorate the sales of over 4 million copies, the blue version is being sold online as a special project jointly carried out by Nintendo, Shogakukan, and convenience store Lawson.
>
> The mail order period is from June 13th to August 31st.
>
> For details on mail order applications, please check Shogakukan's grade magazines, magazines such as CoroCoro Comic, Ciao, or Lawson.

### Contents

#### Cartridge

Unlike *Red*, *Green*, or *Yellow*, *Blue* always has the same four cartridge stamp codes: `00`, `12`, `20`, and `22`, with known launch copies using `20`.

![Blue version cartridge label with production code 20](/uploads/blue-20-cart.png)

There are likely parallel codes used at launch, but that's still unclear.

When looking at the circuit board for the above cartridge, the date code (`9646K7024`) is a few weeks before the December release date, indicating its a first, or at least very early production copy.

Here is the reference to those cartridge production codes from the previous post:

![Cartridge production codes for Red, Green, Blue, and Yellow versions](/uploads/cart-code-table.png)

#### Matching Paperwork

The below information was determined by a thorough survey of listing data on *eBay*, *Mercari* (Japanese), and *Yahoo! Auction Japan*.

Early prints of *Blue* might not have included any ads, unlike Red and Blue at the time.

![](/uploads/blue-version-complete-early-no-ad.jpeg)

While unconfirmed for now, if ads were included, it would have been a *Game Boy Pocket* ad:

By the time *Blue* reached retail proper, the game would include ads for *Game Boy Color, Game Boy Camera*, and *Pocket Monsters Stadium*. The manual also received a revision as noted by the `-1` code on the front.

Each piece of hardware advertised was released at the time and are consistent in numerous listed samples on websites like *Yahoo! Auction Japan*, *Mercari*, and the like. Sibling games *Red*, *Green*, and *Yellow* also contain these ads.

## Pocket Monsters: Yellow

![Pocket Monsters: Blue version, front and back](/uploads/yellow-hero.jpg)

*Yellow* version proves simple in its box variants with two distinct printings, however its cartridge is more complex.

### Seal & Box

To start, the 24-hour pre-release version came in a sealed bag with post cards, the cards being the first instance such an addition was included.

Other than the bag, the box has no difference from post-release variants.

![](/uploads/878278c8-95bc-4a0c-b73d-d5e536166372.jpeg)

The two notes in the top corner translate (roughly) to:

> 1. Get the game 1 day earlier than actual release
> 2. Get exclusive postcards only available through pre-order

Similarly, down in the bottom right corner, the preorder window is stated as `8/10 ~ 9/6`, and a pickup date of `9/11`. 

Any copy acquired this way would definitively be the earliest possible print. 

A﻿dditionally, there is one documented copy of this pre-release *Yellow* version that was graded by VGA. It came sealed in the bag, so VGA denoted it as "uncirculated" before encapsulating it. VGA returned the baggie to the owner as shown in the photo below.

### Cartridge

Like *Red* and *Green*, *Yellow* has multiple production codes, some exclusive to the very earliest print run. They include `00`, `12`, `20`, and `22`.

Later print runs were quite complicated, however. Each letter in the production code indicates a full revision. Given there are codes ending in `D`, that means Yellow had at least **four** additional revisions produced.

Numeral-only production codes would likely be tied to the earliest paperwork included (see below).

### Matching Paperwork

Unlike its predecessors, the late release of *Yellow* in *Game Boy*'s lifecycle meant it wouldn't have major changes to inserts, mainly just the ads.

The components included at launch are:

* Manual
* Map
* Anti-tampering warning
* Game Boy Pocket ad (`MGB001-JPN-3`)
* Game Boy Camera ad (`MGB006-JPN`)
* Pocket Monsters Stadium ad (`APSJ-JPN`)

![](/uploads/yellow-version-early-print-complete.jpeg)

A later revision would update the *Game Boy* ad for *Game Boy Color* (`CGB001-JPN-2`)*.* The rest would stay the same.

It's possible that future revisions could have added more *Game Boy Color*-era inserts, such as the cleaning instructions included with *Gold*, *Silver*, and *Crystal*.
