title: "Pocket Monsters: Blue & Yellow Print Variant Breakdown"
description: A visual guide to the next two entries in the first generation of Pokemon
---
This is the second part of a series all about Pocket Monsters print variants, as a follow up to the previous [post](https://www.afew.games/essays/pocket-monsters-red-green-early-print-breakdown) which focused on the early prints of *Red* & *Green* versions.

*This post is supplemental to the database. To see a list of first generation* Pocket Monsters *print variants as they exist on A Few Games, [view them here](https://www.afew.games/?search=pocket+monsters&platform=game+boy). A full list of sources can be found at the end of this post.*

## Pocket Monsters: Blue

*Blue* version is unique for a few reasons. First, it started the first of a "sealed bag" treatment that would continue through *Crystal* version. It also was the first and only game to have a mail order launch before hitting retail proper.

### Mail Order Release

*Blue* version was [announced on October 15th, 1996](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Blue_Version_(Japanese)), then [featured in CoroCoro Comic](https://lavacutcontent.com/corocoro-comic-pokemon-blue/) where readers were informed they could purchase & receive the game by mail. In this model, *Blue* verison was the only made-to-order entry ever made. It's unclear exactly how many copies were produced for the campaign.

*CoroCoro Comic magazine spread, with application and instructions to receive* Blue *version*

*CoroCoro* readers could expect to receive their copy of *Pocket Monsters Blue* in mid-December of that year, at the earliest, and orders after November would likely arrive by January or February in the new year.

This initial version included a plastic bag. The application period was October 15th through December 27th, 1996, to celebrate one million sales for *Red* and *Green*.

### Contents

#### Box

According to @RB1989421GB on *X/Twitter*, the retail version was supposedly only made available after *Yellow* version released, on October 10, 1999 (almost three years after the mail order version).

While the mail order variant had no barcode on the actual box (see above photos), the retail release included it:

Uniquely, before the retail version, *Blue* had an exclusive *TOYOTA AUTO* promotion that features a sticker. The box doesn't appear to have any different characteristics compared to the mail order variant.

According to @RB1989421GB on X/*Twitter* (translated roughly):

> The Toyota version was distributed as a commemorative gift to those who signed a contract during the Toyota campaign period in 1997, as a set of Toyota limited model *Game Boy Pocket Skeleton & Pokemon Blue Version*. There is a Toyota Auto **sticker** on the box.

#### Cartridge

Unlike *Red*, *Green*, or *Yellow*, *Blue* always has the same four cartridge stamp codes: `00`, `12`, `20`, and `22`, with known launch copies using `20`.

There are likely parallel codes used at launch, but that's still unclear.

When looking at the circuit board for the above cartridge, the date code (`9646K7024`) is a few weeks before the December release date, indicating its a first, or at least very early production copy.

Here is the reference to those cartridge production codes from the previous post:

#### Manual

Apart from having updated ad inserts for the much later 1999 release, *Blue* received a single manual revision sometime after the *Toyota* promotion in 1997. This was likely for the retail version only

The part code on the initial run is `DMG-APEJ-JPN`, and the revision is `DMG-APEJ-JPN-1`.

#### Matching Paperwork

![Inserts shown for both mail order and retail print of Pocket Monsters: Blue](/uploads/e_wwxh8vqaqcx7p.jpg)

While unconfirmed, if the source on X/Twitter is reliable, the mail order version seems to include both a *Nintendo 64* ad, and at least one retail print variant included a *Game Boy Color* ad *(code: `T-DMG-CGB001-JPN`),* which lines up with the 1999 release timeframe.

When, or if, the ads changed from one to the other is still unclear, however looking at listings on the market place shows a possible insert timeline like so:

* 1996 – mail order release: *Game Boy Pocket* ad
* 1997 – Toyota promotion: *Nintendo 64* ad
* 1999 – retail release: *Game Boy Color* ad

Information is still needed to confirm this theory one way or another, but it \*does\* line up with hardware and prevalence of certain ads during those years.

## Pocket Monsters: Yellow

![Pocket Monsters: Blue version, front and back](/uploads/yellow-hero.jpg)

*Yellow* version proves simple in its box variants with two distinct printings, however its cartridge is more complex.

### Seal & Box

To start, the 24-hour pre-release version came in a sealed bag with post cards, the cards being the first instance such an addition was included.

Other than the bag, the box has no difference from post-release variants.

The two notes in the top corner translate (roughly) to:

> 1. Get the game 1 day earlier than actual release
> 2. Get exclusive postcards only available through pre-order

Similarly, down in the bottom right corner, the preorder window is stated as `8/10 ~ 9/6`, and a pickup date of `9/11`. 

Any copy acquired this way would definitively be the earliest possible print. 

A﻿dditionally, there is one documented copy of this pre-release *Yellow* version that was graded by VGA. It came sealed in the bag, so VGA denoted it as "uncirculated" before encapsulating it. VGA returned the baggie to the owner as shown in the photo below.

### Cartridge

Like *Red* and *Green*, *Yellow* has multiple codes, some exclusive to the very earliest print run. They include `00`, `12`, `20`, and `22`.

Later print runs were quite complicated, however. Each letter in the production code indicates a full revision. Given there are codes ending in `D`, that means Yellow had at least **four** additional revisions produced.

Other than the cartridge, other contents aren't likely to have any differences despite the cartridge being updated so often. Especially considering the game's release is so late in the *Game Boy*'s lifespan.

I hope this dive down history lane was helpful! It makes for a fun collecting hunt when you can find the most obscure, early prints of these extremely common games. Best of luck in your search!
