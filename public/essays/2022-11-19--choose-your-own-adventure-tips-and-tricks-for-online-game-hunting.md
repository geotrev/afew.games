description: Searching for games doesn't need to be confusing; use this guide to
  fill your collection!

It can be intimidating to look for things online. The internet has somewhere around a billion websites, after all. but that doesn't mean searching for video games - or really anything specific you might need - needs to be difficult. As such, this isn't so much a "how to search for video games" article as much as a "how to search for stuff" one.

So let's talk strategy. Where should you start? How should you approach the process of hunting for your beloved video games?

The cold truth here is that you will likely need to put in the work - not unlike grinding your party level in your RPG of choice. It takes patience and determination. But if I can succeed at this for years, so can you!

In this article, I'll answer the following key questions:

* Which websites should I use?
* How do I search effectively?
* Should I negotiate with sellers?
* Should I bother with auctions?
* How do I watch for new listings?

As well, I'll go over some other video-game-specific resources.

Most important, at each step I'll point you in the direction of the features I've found most useful!

## Which websites should I use?

Of course, the simplest place to start is which websites are most likely to have your target games. The answer to this question will also depend on your sub-category of collecting.

The best question to ask yourself at this point is what form factor you want your games to be in. Cartridge (loose)? Do you want the box and manual too? Or do you want to jump right to sealed? There are nuances within these paths as well, for instance: do you want both sealed and an extra cartridge to actually play the game? If so, then you'll need to consider a combination of approaches to find your items.

Piggy-backing off of the above questions, here is a list of websites that will help you land on your feet:

* **eBay:** Find any and all forms of your target video game. Likely to be your main source for any path you take.
* **Mercari:** A japanese website with a USA/EU presence. Similar to eBay, but with less options and less buyer protection.
* **OfferUp:** A CraigsList-style website, with less even less protections and less options than Mercari. Use at your own risk, although it can be a good source to keep in your back pocket.
* **Heritage Auctions, CertifiedLink, Goldin Auctions, and Hakes:** Auction houses that often only sell sealed and graded video games. You can find these elsewhere, but if this is your primary focus, there's a chance your game could be auctioned in an upcoming session.

Choose one or multiple options. Personally, I stick to eBay and auction houses. For the purposes of this article, I'll focus on eBay as the main example since it's the biggest platform by a long shot.

## How do I search effectively?

The best chance at finding your games is to study and use a given website's search tools. For eBay, you can generally steer clear of the advanced search page and simply use the search bar and the various features its provides (we'll cover that below).

Also, it's generally good to only *loosely* rely on listing categories. Reason being is many people list goods in incorrect categories and those items will be entirely excluded from search results if you're focused solely on the "Video Games" category. 

Personally, I *start* a search from "Video Games", but go back to "All Categories" if the results didn't satisfy me.

### Search term customization

Take advantage of eBay's optional search term feature. Here's how that looks in practice:

Refer to the breakdown above. Your "main search term" is the meat of the search. The "optional terms" will prioritize applicable listings. Use quotes around an optional term if it contains spaces.

The other websites I listed above have their own equivalent to this type of feature. It's very useful and saves you time!

## Should I negotiate with sellers?

This can be a hit or miss strategy for some people. The short answer is yes, you should generally attempt to negotiate with a seller if given the option. For instance, on eBay, listings occasionally have a "Make Offer" button.

The caveat here is to really weigh if the offer is worth the time it takes for the seller to respond. If an item is already listed "low" compared to sold listings, then it might just be worth buying it immediately. I typically ask myself, "is the discount I would get worth the chance at losing this item?" and proceed from there.

Similarly, sometimes auction listings have an option to make an offer. This tends to work in the opposite direction: a seller is less likely to take an offer unless the item already looks like it's going to sell low. Use your best judgement and choose the option that makes the most sense in your scenario.

## Should I bother with auction houses?

The reason I added this section specifically is because the answer might be surprising. Of course, the main reason for this option will likely be for sealed and graded video games. 

To reiterate, auction houses will include Heritage Auctions, CertifiedLink, Goldin Auctions, and Hakes, among others.

### But wait, aren't prices higher at auction?

Not always! In a down market (which is the case as of this writing), auctioned items tend to sell for much lower than active listings elsewhere online. It might seem obvious, but when people don't want to spend money, they won't show up for auctions or will simply bid lower.

## How do I watch for new listings?

After you've organized your search, and feel good about the breadth of results, you still might not see your game at a price you like. This is common depending on the game you want.

I tend to sort by "Time: newly listed", save the search, and enable email notifications. 

Since email notifications won't always be timely, I'm usually checking ebay multiple times a day on the app just to see if new things are listed. This is the "grind" aspect to hunting online that will be the least glamorous, although it's very necessary at times.

## Conclusion

Getting in the habit of game hunting can be time-intensive, but sometimes that just comes with the territory. 

The topics we covered include websites for listings, using search features for better searches, negotiating (or not) with sellers, and strategies for new listings.

I hope this was helpful!
