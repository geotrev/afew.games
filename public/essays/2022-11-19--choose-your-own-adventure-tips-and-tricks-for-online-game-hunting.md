It can be intimidating to hunt games online. Listings always have high prices, sometimes there aren't many options, and there's always several websites to think about. Also, am I even using these websites "correctly"? You start with one question and balloon into half a dozen quickly.

The internet has somewhere around a billion websites, but that doesn't mean searching for video games – or really anything at all – needs to be difficult. As such, this write-up might help you in any or all of your consumer endeavors.

So let's talk strategy. Where should you start? How should you approach the process of hunting for video games?

The cold truth here is that you will likely need to put in a surprising amount of work – not unlike grinding your party level in your RPG of choice. It takes patience and determination. But if I can succeed at this for years, so can you!

We'll answer the following key questions:

* Which websites should I use?
* How do I search effectively?
* Should I negotiate with sellers?
* Should I bother with auctions?
* How do I watch for new listings?

I'll go over some some other video-game-specific resources at the end, as well.

Worth noting, I will focus primarily on eBay in this write-up to make the examples as streamlined as possible.

## Which websites should I use?

Of course, the simplest place to start is which websites are most likely to have your target games. The answer to this question will also depend on your sub-category of collecting.

Here's a quick round-up:

* **eBay:** The obvious and biggest choice. Find any and all forms of your target video game (CIB, sealed, or loose carts).
* **Mercari:** A Japanese website with a USA/EU presence. Similar to eBay, but with less options and less buyer protection.
* **OfferUp:** A Craigslist-style website, with less even less protections and less options than Mercari. Use at your own risk, although it can be a good source to keep in your back pocket.
* **StandardGaming** and **Metropolis Comics**: Great resources if you're going after fixed priced marketplaces. These mainly provide sealed & graded video games.
* **Heritage Auctions, CertifiedLink, ComicConnect, PWCC, Goldin Auctions, and Hakes:** Auction houses that often only sell sealed and graded video games. You can also purchase previously sold games if a buy out price is given. Some of them (like Heritage) also have fixed prices if a buyer relists their game after buying at auction.
* **Google:** While it doesn't directly have listings, Google is of course a great search engine and can provide additional visibility into resources, like brick and mortar shops. I've had great luck with those int he past.

Choose one or multiple options. Personally, I stick to eBay for almost everything, and dabble int he others as needed.

## How do I search effectively?

My main advice here is to search from a specific category, then work your way up into more general umbrella categories if you can't find what you're looking for.

Personally, I *start* a search from "Video Games", but go back to "Video Games & Consoles", then finally "All" if the results didn't satisfy me.

### Search Commands aka Search Superpowers

Take advantage of eBay's search commands as often as possible. Here's how that looks in practice:

Refer to the breakdown above. Your "main search term" is the meat of the search. The "keywords" will prioritize applicable listings. Use quotes around a term to search exactly that content. Finally, the "excluded" terms will ignore listings if they contain those words.

The other websites I listed above have their own equivalent to this type of feature. It's very useful and saves you time!

You can read all about the other search commands available to you [here](https://www.ebay.com.sg/pages/help/search/search-commands.html), but the above options are what I rely on.

## Should I negotiate with sellers?

This can be a hit or miss strategy for some people. The short answer is yes, you should generally attempt to negotiate with a seller if given the option. For instance, on eBay, listings occasionally have a "Make Offer" button.

The caveat here is to really weigh if the offer is worth the time it takes for the seller to respond. If an item is already listed "low" compared to sold listings, then it might just be worth buying it immediately. I typically ask myself, "is the discount I would get worth the chance at losing this item?" and proceed from there.

Similarly, sometimes auction listings have an option to make an offer. This tends to work in the opposite direction: a seller is less likely to take an offer unless the item already looks like it's going to sell low. Use your best judgement and choose the option that makes the most sense in your scenario.

## Should I bother with auction houses?

The reason I added this section specifically is because the answer might be surprising. Of course, the main reason for this option will likely be for sealed and graded video games. 

To reiterate, auction houses will include Heritage Auctions, CertifiedLink, Goldin Auctions, and Hakes, among others.

### But wait, aren't prices higher at auction?

Not always! In a down market (which is the case as of this writing), auctioned items tend to sell for much lower than active listings elsewhere online. It might seem obvious, but when people don't want to spend money, they won't show up for auctions or will simply bid lower.

## How do I watch for new listings?

After you've organized your search, and feel good about the breadth of results, you still might not see your game at a price you like. This is common depending on the game you want.

I tend to sort by "Time: newly listed", save the search, and enable email notifications. 

Since email notifications won't always be timely, I'm usually checking ebay multiple times a day on the app just to see if new things are listed. This is the "grind" aspect to hunting online that will be the least glamorous, although it's very necessary at times.

## Conclusion

Getting in the habit of game hunting can be time-intensive, but sometimes that just comes with the territory. 

The topics we covered include websites for listings, using search features for better searches, negotiating (or not) with sellers, and strategies for new listings.

I hope this was helpful!
