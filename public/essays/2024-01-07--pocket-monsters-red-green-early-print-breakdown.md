  started it all for Pokemon

This post is the first part in a multi-essay series dedicated to Pocket Monsters. In this first entry, we'll cover _Red_ and _Green_ versions!

_NOTE: This post is supplemental to the database. To see a list of first generation_ Pocket Monsters _print variants as they exist on A Few Games, [view them here](https://www.afew.games/?search=pocket+monsters&platform=game+boy). A full list of sources can be found at the end of this post._

Given they were the first games to release for the franchise in February 1996, _Green_ and _Red_ have some complex data behind them. The games themselves were prone to bugs, and multiple prints happened before the design settled near the end of 1996 in time for _Blue_ version, then later in 1998 for _Yellow_ version.

With the help of packaging references, official _Nintendo_ interviews, and production data, here is a breakdown of the very early days of _Pocket Monsters: Red & Green_ as physical games.

## Box

Early versions of both _Red_ and _Green_ version had wider barcodes compared to later prints.

## Contents

A few key components are important when identifying first production examples, particularly on the cartridge and the inclusion of a customer feedback postcard.

The only inserts included were the _Super Game Boy_ ad and a yellow link cable insert. All copies included the manual (of course) and a fold-out map of the Kanto region.

### Green Version

### Red Version

### Cartridge

All Game Boy cartridges have a production stamp code on the label.

Here is a confirmed example of a first-production copy of _Green_ version with `00` production code:

![Pocket Monsters: Green with label stamp code 00](/uploads/green-cart-label.png)

A _Red_ or _Green_ cartridge from the true first print runs will have a **strictly numerical** code stamped on the label.

_NOTE: There are unconfirmed reports of no-code cartridges, but historically these have been an indication of a reproduction. No direct evidence suggests this is a real phenomenon on authentic copies of these games._

[Mask ROM](https://handwiki.org/wiki/Mask_ROM) date codes coinciding with the below label codes suggest these were among the very first manufactured:

- _Green_ label code: `00`
- _Red_ label code: `22`

A look at the circuit boards (PCBs) of _Green_ and _Red_ indicate they were produced a few months before the launch of the game (around November 1995).

According to sources, _Red_ would later receive a `00` label code, and Green received a `20` code as well, but this was well after the initial release period (late April into May 1996).

The board chips were produced a little bit later in this case, in the fourth or fifth week of 1996 (component date codes: `9605` (_Red_) and `9604` (_Green_); `96` is the year and `05`/`04` is the week).

Finally, sometime before November 1996 (likely around June as indicated by the earliest date codes of these revisions), the label codes `00A` (_Green_) and `22A` (_Red_) were printed for the `1.1` software version (which would also be the sole revision used on _Blue_ version, released in December of the same year).

Here's a translated reference on which label codes can be found on _Red_, _Green_, _Blue_, and _Yellow_ versions, as gathered by folks in the Japanese collecting/gaming communities (source linked at the end of this post):

![Early vs later stamp codes for Red & Green version cartridges](/uploads/cart-code-table.png)

Worth noting is that the letter at the end of the code (e.g., `A` or `B`) typically denote a software revision for bug fixes and the like. Yellow is well known for having many patches (since it had codes with `D`, it had at least four revisions).

Something else that remains unclear here is the `1M` code for _Green_ version. This needs additional research to know exactly what caused the jump from A to M. Perhaps a very late print in the game's lifespan. If a PCB with those codes emerge, it will be very illuminating!

### Survey

Another document included in the earliest printings is a customer feedback postcard, only available during the first 30 days after release, and had to be postmarked by the end of March. Customers would be entered into a free raffle for the official guidebook or special playing cards, as well as an additional copy of either _Red_ or _Green_ version.

Interesting fact: Ishihara-san, President & CEO of _Game Freak,_ [indicated](https://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/ds/pokemon/0/0/) in an interview that initial sales were lower than expected during the first 30 days, which explains why these surveys are relatively scarce today.

![Feedback survey, front](/uploads/survey-front.png)

The front of the postcard translates to roughly the following:

> _Kyoto City Higashiyama Post Office P.O. Box No. 15_
>
> _Thank you for purchasing Pocket Monsters. Sorry to trouble you, we request your opinion as valuable reference for future software._
>
> _Additionally, a lottery will be run for participants. Winners may receive:_
>
> - _(100 Winners) Pocket Monsters Guidebook_
> - _(500 Winners) Special Playing Cards_
>
> _In addition, the announcement of the winner will receive a free copy of either version. This is valid until the end of March, 1996._

The bottom box (featuring _Bulbasaur)_ in the survey (roughly) reads:

> _It's all about Pocket Monsters!_
>
> _"Pocket Monsters Guidebook"_
>
> _– List price undecided –_
>
> _Scheduled to be released early March, 1996._

This text lines up perfectly for the late February release of the games.

Sources also also tell me that the surveys appear to be uniformly were printed with the _Red_ model code, `DMG-APAJ-JPN` (where `APAJ` is the _Red_ code). A _Green_ version code has yet to be uncovered for these postcards.

And of course, here is the other (informational) side customers would fill out:

I hope this dive down history lane was fun! It makes for an interesting hunt when you can find the most obscure, early prints of these otherwise abundant games.
