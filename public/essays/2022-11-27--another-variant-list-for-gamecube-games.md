title: Another Variant List for GameCube Games
description: Do you like variants? Because there are a lot for some of these
  games and it's getting out of control

I've done a variant list or two in the past, and the inevitable consensus seems to be how annoying it is these variant lists are not documented somewhere sane, like VGDB or Wata (when its modern pop report is released we'll have a better sense of variants, but they likely won't include the variants collectors haven't submitted yet).

Anyway, I wanted to add some more variant lists just to get them "out there" while I'm still working on a visual variant database. My ideal goal is just creating a new website to house these variants, and let people submit games and variants.

But until that glorious day comes, enjoy these variants!
