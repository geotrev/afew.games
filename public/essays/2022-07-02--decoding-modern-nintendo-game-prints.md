title: Decoding Modern Nintendo Game Prints
description: Gone are the days of memorizing every dot on a box; in are the days
  of standardized print data!

With the release of the Nintendo Wii and DS, Nintendo made identifying game prints much easier. While they still use(d) major revision differences in "player's choice," they also introduced a new discrete data point in the form of "satellite codes." These are positioned right next to a game's primary UPC on the back of a case/box.

To start, take the UPC of <game> as a reference:

Let's explain these details a bit:

1. **Satellite Code:** Denotes the product's manufacturing code as well as the revision. The first five (sometimes six) digits is the product code, and the ending letter is the revision. "A" is first, "B" second, etc. In my experience, USA copies have the lowest product code, but you can always refer to the regional text, often located very close to the main UPC, which can say "USA" or "CAN" for United States and canada, respectively.
2. **Regional UPC:** Indicates both the region of manufacture and revision. The third number from the left is the region (0 for Japan, 1 for USA), and the far right number is the revision (0 is first, 1 is second, etc; often a mirror of the satellite revision code, but not always). This is less important than the satellite code, but is good to know about.

There are probably more official names for these, so bear with me. :)

Here's additional examples on other Nintendo consoles. It's always the same combination, but laid out differently.

Of course, like all things, there are and have been exceptions/mistakes where games are printed with the wrong code but the error was noticed too late in the production process. Similarly, third parties don't always respect the satellite code/regional UPC pattern like Nintendo. 

To better explain the case of third parties, here's the UPC of Bayonetta 2 on Wii U denoting a `00000` regional UPC with "Made in USA" text, where that code clearly should have been `00100`.

## Dual-Language Variants

It's not all fun and games, though. You still need to be wary of which might get print runs in multiple languages. They have satellite codes that still denote a "first print" code like `XXXXXXA`, but the locale text might indicate "CAN" (for Canada) with both English and French text throughout the case art.

Again, *this is still a first print*, however it is regional to Canada, in this case. 

## Market Preference & Prices

I'm not going to pretend that there isn't a tendency for collectors to prefer NTSC-U (USA) copies of games. It has been and continues to be the norm. As a result, finding new copies of certain modern games will be a challenge as more resellers at large are seeing NTSC-U, first-print satellite codes as the key to profit. Especially with modern game grading becoming as prevalent as it is (akin to comics and sports cards).

To work around this, you'll see an immense discount when finding CAN variants of your favorite games. They will still play on your console and even have the same language options (heck, probably even the same default language in your case!). The strict difference is often the packaging alone!

## Conclusion

I hope this has been a helpful introduction to the concept of modern Nintendo game print variants. There really isn't any magic here. Like all game variants, however, if you can't find information online, you can always hit up eBay and compile a list of satellite codes (along with other identifying markers, such as Not For Resale/NFR labels and Nintendo Select/Player's Choice banners) and find the print you're after (which, let's be honest, is the first print).
