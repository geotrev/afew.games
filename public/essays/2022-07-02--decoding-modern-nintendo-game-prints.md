title: Decoding Modern Nintendo Game Prints
description: Gone are the days of memorizing every dot on a box; in are the days
  of standardized print data!

With the release of the Nintendo Wii and DS, Nintendo made identifying game prints much easier. While they still use(d) major revision differences in "player's choice," they also introduced a new discrete data point in the form of "satellite codes." These are positioned right next to a game's primary UPC on the back of a case/box. 

Thankfully, these codes have persisted even to the most recent generation of games (Nintendo Switch).

To start, take the UPC of *Hyrule Warriros* on the Switch as a reference:

Let's explain these details a bit:

1. **Satellite Code:** Denotes the product's manufacturing code as well as the revision. The first five (sometimes six) digits indicate a product code. The last character, usually a letter, is the revision, starting with "A" for the first release, then "B" for next revision, etc.
2. **Region Code**: Indicates both the region of manufacture and revision. The third number from the left is the region (`0` for Japan, `1` for USA), and the far right number is the revision (`0` is first, `1` is second, etc). Note that the revision here may not always directly reflection the revision in the satellite code, but usually does. To validate this further, the "Made in USA" or "Made in Japan" text, always near the UPC, will validate the regional code.
3. **Locale:** This indicates the intended region for general consumer distribution. In this case, the ending (e.g., `USA`) is what matters. Sometimes it will say `USZ` if meant for a combination of US, Canada, and/or Mexico, or `CAN` if intended specifically for Canada.

There are probably more official names for these, so bear with me. :)

Here's additional examples on other Nintendo consoles. It's always the same combination, but laid out differently.

Of course, like all things, there are and have been exceptions/mistakes where games are printed with the wrong code but the error was noticed too late in the production process. Similarly, third parties don't always respect the satellite code/regional UPC pattern like Nintendo. 

Here's an example in *Kingdom Hearts: 358/2 Days* on Nintendo DSwhere Square Enix omitted the revision character in the satellite code and entirely omitted the regional code sub-UPC.

(Apologies if that's hard to read!)

Here's another odd example of *Bayonetta 2* (2nd party developer) on Wii U, showing a `00000` region code UPC with "Made in USA" text, where that code clearly should have been `00100`. According to [ModernDB](https://www.instagram.com/Moderndatabase/), this was common for this manufacturer.

In case you're worried that big box games don't have these codes, fear not. While they may not have the regional code and UPC, they will still include satellite and regional codes.

## Market Preference & Prices

I'm not going to pretend that there isn't a tendency for collectors to prefer NTSC-U (USA) copies of games. It has been and continues to be the norm.

As a result, finding new copies of certain modern games will be a challenge as more resellers at large are seeing NTSC-U, first-print satellite codes as the key to profit. Especially with modern game grading becoming as prevalent as it is (akin to comics and sports cards).

To work around this, you'll see an immense discount when finding CAN variants of your favorite games. They will still play on your console and even have the same language options (heck, probably even the same default language in your case!). The strict difference is often the packaging alone!

## Conclusion

I hope this has been a helpful introduction to the concept of modern Nintendo game print variants. There really isn't any magic here. Like all game variants, however, if you can't find information online, you can always hit up eBay and compile a list of satellite codes (along with other identifying markers, such as Not For Resale/NFR labels and Nintendo Select/Player's Choice banners) and find the print you're after (which, let's be honest, is the first print).
