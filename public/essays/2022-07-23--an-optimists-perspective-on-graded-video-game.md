title: An optimists perspective on video game collecting
description: A lot is changing in the hobby, and there's much to look forward to
---
In my [previous article](https://www.afew.games/essays/the-unfortunate-state-of-graded-games), I broke down some of the unfortunate shortcomings of graded video games. Particularly, the capitalists mentality, which saw explosive growth during between 2019 and 2021, as well as the continued degradation of product quality between both Wata and VGA. Thankfully, things are calming down now, partially due to a receding economy, but also due to the speculative sub-group of participants fleeing in an effort to keep their gains.

We owe it to ourselves to take a moment to zoom out, and take a broader look at the hobby. What has changed in the last 10 years? Is it all doom and gloom, where every "true" game collector is priced out of the hobby because of exploding game values?

For the purposes of this discussion, all figures are represented using American sales data.

## Financial Health of the Video Game Market

A lot has changed in just the last ten years. Currently, it might feel like games have never been more expensive, and supply is stretched even more thin. But nothing grows forever, and eventually a crash or correction is inevitable. Plus, it just depends on the types of video games you collect.

Since every individual video game is largely its own micro-market, we need to take a broader look to understand the trends. To the rescue is [pricecharting](https://www.pricecharting.com/)!

The best way to get a baseline trend in any market is to get a sense of where prices might naturally progress in an unmanipulated, unspeculated market. As mentioned before, right around 2019 and 2020, prices began to spike (surprise) because of the pandemic and lockdowns; everyone wanted their childhood comfort items, which for many of us were our video games.

Now that we're nearing the end of 2022, lockdowns aren't a thing and folks are looking to get back to living their life, among other reasons, prices are beginning to correct due to lower demand and a receding market in the USA.

This "correction" phase is somewhat informed by the fact that averages near the very end of the timeline are beginning to sink. This is a more reliable metric mainly because of how there are hundreds of thousands of sales happening, so this shouldn't be
