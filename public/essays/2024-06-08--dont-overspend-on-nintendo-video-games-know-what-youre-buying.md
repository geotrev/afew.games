title: "Don't Overspend On Nintendo Video Games: Know What You're Buying!"
description: Collector's love a good first print, but how do you know that's
  what you're buying?

Way back in July, 2022, the [first post](https://www.afew.games/essays/decoding-modern-nintendo-print-variants) I wrote on this blog was a breakdown of modern Nintendo video game variants. Given the recent [Sixth Generation & Beyond Showcase Auction](https://comics.ha.com/c/auction-home.zx?saleNo=44255&ic=breadcrumb-comics-121913-interior) over at Heritage Auctions this week, I think it's a great time for a refresher, and word of caution, to those buying these games. Especially to be informed of what you're buying to save yourself from overspending on a game that's been misrepresented to you in the marketplace.

> **N﻿OTE:** It isn't my intention to paint Heritage Auctions or any seller as intentionally misleading buyers. Instead, it's to show how easy it is to mis-identify an item due to the complex nature of mass-production and manufacturing.

## C﻿ollector Motivations

What is a key factor for collectors buying video games? Often it's the print run. Earlier prints tend to be most sought after for a few reasons, but most importantly: they're always less available than those from subsequent print runs.

For a price comparison, let's look at *The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild* for *Nintendo Switch*. In this Thursday's auction, you'll find this game sold in mint grade (VGA 95) for vastly different prices. [The first print](https://comics.ha.com/itm/video-games/nintendo/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-vga-95-mint-sealed-105211a-first-production-switch-nintendo-2017-usa/a/44255-79042.s?ic4=GalleryView-Thumbnail-071515) (`105211A` product code) sold for $6250 (including buyer's premium). The later print, [Explorer's Guide variant](https://comics.ha.com/itm/video-games/nintendo/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-vga-95-mint-sealed-starter-pack-switch-nintendo-2018-usa/a/44255-79045.s?ic4=GalleryView-ShortDescription-071515), sold in the same for "just" $937.50.

## Marketplace Confusion

What happens when people seem to have a first print, but actually don't? It happens everywhere, unfortunately. Here are two worthwhile examples.

In the same auction as the aforementioned first Breath of the Wild, a "first print" [Pokemon Y for Nintendo 3DS](https://comics.ha.com/itm/video-games/nintendo/pokemon-y-vga-90-nm-mt-sealed-101527a-first-production-3ds-nintendo-2013-usa/a/44255-79027.s?ic4=GalleryView-Thumbnail-071515) was advertised (`101527A` product code). The catch though is that this is not a first print, but might appear as one given there is an A revision in the product code. There are multiple prints that came before, including the true first print (`80781A` product code), notable for having the legacy ESRB rating design (black vs white background).

H﻿A isn't alone in misidentifying these games. You can find plenty on eBay, graded mint by VGA, CGC, and Wata, with listing details claiming them to be first print. Take [this Mario Kart 8 Deluxe](https://www.ebay.com/itm/115932572041) for example, which was printed in 2020 (`113550A` product code), listed for $900. Again, it appears as a first print, but this is the "Not For Resale" variant [included with Super Mario Party](https://www.target.com/p/mario-kart-8-deluxe-super-mario-party-double-pack-nintendo-switch/-/A-80960673#lnk=sametab).

This Mario Kart 8 Deluxe listing is also notable because a true first print copy [sold this week](https://comics.ha.com/c/auction-home.zx?saleNo=44255&ic=breadcrumb-comics-121913-interior) in the same grade for $1156.25. Someone might see this sale, then later look at the eBay listing above thinking its a steal, but **these are not the same item**!

Someone watching this week's Heritage Auction's showcase might see the mint graded

## Common Misconceptions

A well intentioned, but misinformed factor I've seen is misattributing the satellite code (five digit, secondary UPC) on the game as solely indicating a first print. In all the examples I've shown above, they have `00000` satellite codes, but now you know a first print and later print can both have this code.

L﻿astly, you will likely see another misconception, which is that Japan printed games are always printed first. While true in some cases (*Super Smash Bros. Melee*, *Wind Waker*), it isn't in others (*Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door*, *New Super Mario Bros Wii*, *Super Mario Bros for Wii U*, and *Mario Kart 8*).

## F﻿ollow The Data

R﻿ecently I came across a fantastic technical design document, source unknown, but shown to me by a member of the collecting community. This document (or one very similar) is what Nintendo would have sent to manufacturers and publishers to align their games with the Nintendo brand and image. I recommend taking a close look, especially at the descriptions of codes.

W﻿ith all this information in mind, how can we truly identify a first print? The answer is unsatisfying, but here is my recommended approach:

* Product code is the lowest number among a sample of known prints
* P﻿roduct code has an `A` suffix, indicating it is the first version of the given print
* C﻿ompare artwork to identify old and new details. This can include: dates, logos, and other distinct differences

T﻿here can still be exceptions though. For instance, Japan and USA printed copies can have product codes only one number apart (i.e., `10101A` vs `10102A`). As is the case with games Super Smash Bros. Melee, the Japan variant is still recognized as having the earliest print run (even though it was partially in parallel with the USA version).
