title: Variant Database is Live at A Few Games
description: Look up and track game variants, database to grow in coming months,
  plus more features
---
When I first launched this site last year, one of my long term goals was to set up infrastructure to track game variants in an understandable way. We still live in an era where variants aren't really understood, at least not beyond simple artistic differences on cover art or Player's Choice/Greatest Hits/Platinum Hits vs. standard label.

Last week I quietly pushed up *A Few Games*' official [database](/database) page for variants (in the main navigation). It only has 36 games in it, mostly modern consoles. I'm hoping to add lots of new entries, as far back as NES, and across PlayStation and Xbox platforms.

**This database will always be updating in real time.** My intention is to add variants regularly, either for games I'm collecting or are popular enough to warrant the documentation.

Do you have a game worth adding to the database? [Let me know!](mailto:contact@afew.games) I don't wish to gate-keep games for the page and welcome additions. Perhaps eventually I can streamline this so anyone can fill out a structured form that I can just review and approve. 

I'm also not placing any Copyright restrictions over this data. It's public information, after all.

## Other Features & Changes

Although it's a very tiny change, I've allowed quick URL searches on the Database page. This is useful for sharing specific data with someone.

For example, use this URL to share the variant list for *Mario Kart 7*:

`https://afew.games/database?search=mario+kart+7`

The key here is the `?search=` part. You should add a `+` in place of a space, but some special characters won't work however, like `;` or `<`, for security reasons.

I plan to use this with folks when sharing variants, I think it'll be a handy tool!
