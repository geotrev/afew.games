title: "Wata Games Pop Report Analysis: NES, SNES, and N64"
description: A breakdown of seal grades across the classic home consoles
---
This is a follow up to a similar article published last week, [Wata Games Pop Report Analysis: Game Boy](https://www.afew.games/essays/seal-grades-are-here-for-wata-graded-games), where I shared both high level and focused analyses of each Game Boy pop report. Now that we have seal grades available, we can finally get a sense of where the true gems lay. 

One thing that article exposed for me is that, despite A++ and A+ supposedly being the highest grades to get on a seal, they were surprisingly common! This could be explained in many ways. For one, collectors will likely send in what they think are the best looking games. Another factor think about is Wata's relatively young age; they've only been grading since late 2018; compare that to VGA, Wata's current main competitor, where they opened in 2008! 

Regardless of the reasons, it's clear there are a number of high grade games out there. Worth watching are the initial analysis videos by GetTheGregGames on YouTube. Many consoles tend to average 9.2-9.6 A+, especially Nintendo.

As a caveat to the below data, remember: games submitted to Wata won't and will never be able to represent the wider collecting hobby. This is mainly due to the fact that the hobby and its community is still very small when compared to the larger collecting sphere, and the motivations of grading are at least partially skewed by the highest value items.

Same as before, we'll break down each console into a few metrics:

* Seal grade totals
* Seal grade breakdown across each box grade, starting at 9.0
* The top five submitted games

## Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)

High level seal grade breakdown:

| Seal Grade   | Total | % of Total |
| ------------ | ----- | ---------- |
| A++          | 713   | 6.19%      |
| A+           | 4241  | 36.81%     |
| A            | 4432  | 38.47%     |
| B+           | 1509  | 13.10%     |
| B            | 388   | 3.37%      |
| C+           | 100   | 0.87%      |
| C            | 8     | 0.07%      |
| NS           | 131   | 1.14%      |
| Total Graded | 11522 | 100.00%    |

Of note is the huge submission total at over 11,000 NES games. According to Wata, NES is the single most-submitted platform. PS1 is a "close" second at... 6282. 

Similarly, there's a distinct drop off from A+ to A++. 

Here are the seal grades, starting at 9.0:

| Box Grade         | A++   | A+     | A      | B+    | B     | C+    | C     | NS    | Box Total |
| ----------------- | ----- | ------ | ------ | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | --------- |
| 10                | 2     | 0      | 0      | 0     | 0     | 0     | 0     | 0     | 2         |
| 9.8               | 230   | 398    | 61     | 1     | 0     | 0     | 0     | 0     | 690       |
| 9.6               | 207   | 1029   | 398    | 16    | 2     | 0     | 0     | 1     | 1653      |
| 9.4               | 146   | 1188   | 926    | 111   | 18    | 0     | 0     | 13    | 2402      |
| 9.2               | 56    | 562    | 758    | 154   | 30    | 5     | 0     | 15    | 1580      |
| 9                 | 26    | 315    | 575    | 166   | 25    | 4     | 1     | 20    | 1132      |
| Seal Total        | 667   | 3492   | 2718   | 448   | 75    | 9     | 1     | 49    | 7459      |
| % of Total Graded | 5.79% | 30.31% | 23.59% | 3.89% | 0.65% | 0.08% | 0.01% | 0.43% | 64.74%    |

In addition to seal grade totals, we can also see the total games graded at each box level. Here, roughly 65% of all NES games graded at 9.0 or higher, and about 36% of all games graded were both 9.0 or higher, and A+ or higher. 

And of course, the top 10 submitted games:

| Title                            | Total Graded | % of Total Graded | Notable figures                                                                            |

It's clear Mario and Zelda are the big kids on the playground.

Of interest for those unaware of how rare early print Nintendo games are, is the stark low count for test market variants of Super Mario Bros. (matte and gloss sticker seals), and three total copies of the earliest known Legend of Zelda print. These are truly rare games for iconic franchises, where [folks have paid hundreds of thousands](https://www.ha.com/heritage-auctions-press-releases-and-news/-legend-of-zelda-shatters-world-record-at-870-000-to-kick-off-heritage-auctions-video-games-event.s?releaseId=4241) for them.
