title: "Collectibles & Grading: What Drives Prices?"
description: In 2022, grading collectibles is like saying butter goes on bread.
  Why? Let's talk about the appeal of this category and why prices seem to be in
  a league of their own!

Something I've been putting much more thought into lately is just how diverse the secondary market is in regard to collectibles. There's variety in not just the things people collect, but how they collect them and where the value resides in a given item.

One area I want to touch on specifically is the rise of graded collectibles. 2020-2021 saw an unprecedented spike in this form of collecting, buying, and selling. \[1]

\*\**

Worth understanding before we get too far along, is that collecting is not strictly a consumer mindset. It's also a corporate one. This is to say: companies have and continue to market their products in form of "collectibles," even if the item doesn't appear to be as such in the present day. A good example of this is "collector's" or "limited" edition video games.

On the other side of this coin, there is the consumer aspect, which arguably is what drives the sales persona endeared by corporations when finding a target audience.

We'll be analyzing the market segment of "grading" from both lenses. How corporations have appealed to and antagonized (for lack of a better word) the collector's mindset into seeing grading as a legitimate form of preservation (and to a much more relevant extent, investing).

## Well ain't that beautiful?

In many cases, two of the biggest appeals to a collector in grading their items is simply: aesthetics and value. It looks shiny, people want it, therefore it has value!

But the gory details paint a much more interesting picture. One that greatly exposes humanity's need for the nicest, most coveted items.

I'm referring of course to what I've been long considering the core reasons people persue and exist in the graded collectibles market:

### The three pillars of a graded collectible

1. Condition
2. Authenticity
3. The Grade

Before you jump ahead and say, "why are these pillars? That implies some form of empirical truth!" And you'd be right! All three of these pillars are completely subjective, and that's what makes them such interesting points! They're hotly contended, widely varying factors whose definition will change from person to person. It's precisely this uncertainly that creates such a raw capitalist lense on the entire sub-set of hobbyists using grading services and buying pre-graded items at auction.

Let's talk about each!

## Condition

For as long as collectors, preservationists, and museum curators have existed, one of the chief factors in seeing any item as desirable is its condition (I say this knowing there are always exceptions).

Preserving and maintaining physical history (e.g., a collectible or antique) often means protecting an item from degradation. This means preventing items from blunt force damage, direct sunlight (UV rays, specifically), and dust/dirt/debris, and other factors.

## Authenticity

No one likes a phony, and collectibles are no different. There's a distinct displeasure in purchasing something from a store or individual, only to realize it's a reproduction, or worse, intentional fake designed to extract maximum value at the ignorance of the buyer.

It's for this reason that grading typically comes hand in hand with some measure of certification, "guaranteeing" \[2] an item is the real deal, created from an original source (e.g., a manufacturer contracted by a major corporation owning the intellectual property to that item, for example).

It might seem obvious, but you'd be surprised at how often completely fake, copied, and inauthentic products are on the market. An example of this is Amazon, which is the premiere storefront for online sellers nowadays. Reviewers report receiving reproduction products from listings that have the branding of the primary IP owner plastered all over them. This tends to happen because third party sellers are allowed to sell their products on Amazon, and the only protection against fake items right now is consumers smart enough to notice the difference.

To put it bluntly: imagine spending millions on a famous painting, only to learn it wasn't the original artist who made it, but some guy in his garage. Yikes.

## The Grade

"Buy the grade, not the game." Often a way of saying: an item is desirable enough to have somewhat significant value (or better, a very high value), so get the highest grade possible to command the highest premium.

This is ultimately where grading devolves. Prices determined not by the condition you can see with your own eyes, but by a third party service that has used some systematic analysis to say the condition is at a specific level. An example is PSA, which says its "8" rating is "NM-Mint", "9" rating is "Mint," and "10" rating is "Gem Mint." 

Grade condition descriptors are often in loose parallel to non-graded condition so there is some a lower barrier to entry. 

At the end of the day, the grade really makes the "Condition" favor an official badge of honor, and therefore adds to the aesthetic of a premium product encased, among other reasons, for display.

In some cases, a literal badge is used (see any VGA graded video game, which have bronze, silver, and gold badges which denote a larger condition range).

## Avengers, Assemble!

Put all of these factors together: condition, authenticity, and the grade, and you get artificial vehicles to further drive demand, consequently inflating prices.

It's really that simple.

## Conclusion

My interpretation of graded collectibles isn't the end-all-be-all, but my hope is that understanding these different goals of grading helps shed light on the mechanism at work when dealing with graded collectibles. For better or worse.

## Disclaimer

I own many graded collectibles, particularly graded Pokemon, Yugioh, and Magic the Gathering cards, as well as video games.

I enjoy the hunt for premium condition items, and otherwise just like having my favorite pop culture items preserved for long term appreciation (the sentimental kind, not the money kind; or perhaps a weighted mixture of both, leaning towards sentimental). I display some at home and keep others in off-property storage.

*\[1] I break "collecting" out from buying and selling because there is a distinct mindset that each buyer and seller has; some like to keep their favorite items, and others don't care as much and are driven purely by the financial side. Both are valid, but it's distinct nuance to the existing market behavior.*

*\[2] Most grading companies will protect themselves from liability in the case of certifying a fake item. Either through their service or legal agreement, or buy providing a policy that guarantees the owner of that item to some compensation or replacement.*
