title: "Wata Games Pop Report Analysis: Game Boy"
description: Are the grades what we expected? Let's take a look at the Game Boy lineup!
---

It's finally here! Almost a year after Wata released its initial population data for box grades, Wata has not only updated box grades (as of August 1st, 2022), but added seal grades by hovering on a given grade. It's interesting it took us so long to get here, but I digress.

Here's the statement they released with this change, for reference:

> **Population Reports update**
>
> You’ve been asking, and we’ve finally got them – seal ratings have been added to our Population Reports! We’ve been working hard the last few months to build and accurately represent this critical aspect of our pop reports. Now all populations can display the seal-rating breakdown for each box grade by hovering over the population count. [Pop reports are now updated](https://www.watagames.com/populations/index.html?utm_source=email&utm_medium=marketingemail&utm_campaign=email-watagames-turnaround-times-update-2022aug16) for all listed systems through August 1, 2022!
>
> _\- Wata, Aug. 17, 2022_

While it's not news at this point, being almost a full month late, I did want to share some interesting data I've compiled for Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance!

As a caveat to the below data, remember: games submitted to Wata won't and will never be able to represent the wider collecting hobby. This is mainly due to the fact that the hobby and its community is still very small when compared to the larger collecting sphere, and the motivations of grading are at least partially skewed by the highest value items.

With that said, the data is broken out by console:

- Seal grade totals
- Seal grade breakdown across each box grade, starting at 9.0
- The top five submitted games

## Game Boy

Here's a high level view of all seal grades:

| Seal Grade | Total | %      |
| ---------- | ----- | ------ |
| A++        | 511   | 20.56% |
| A+         | 1177  | 47.36% |
| A          | 600   | 24.14% |
| B+         | 140   | 5.63%  |
| B          | 39    | 1.57%  |
| C+         | 14    | 0.56%  |
| C          | 4     | 0.16%  |
| Total      | 2485  | 100%   |

When we break down seal grades for each box grade, the patterns are clearer, but not entirely surprising:

| Box Grade | A++    | A+     | A      | B+    | B     | C+  | C   |
| --------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ----- | ----- | --- | --- |
| 9.8       | 165    | 53     | 4      | 0     | 0     | 0   | 0   |
| 9.6       | 124    | 202    | 49     | 5     | 1     | 0   | 0   |
| 9.4       | 103    | 254    | 64     | 10    | 1     | 0   | 0   |
| 9.2       | 47     | 172    | 74     | 11    | 5     | 0   | 0   |
| 9.0       | 29     | 130    | 67     | 11    | 2     | 0   | 0   |
| Total     | 468    | 811    | 258    | 37    | 9     | 0   | 0   |
| %         | 18.83% | 32.64% | 10.38% | 1.47% | 0.36% | 0%  | 0%  |

**Over 50% of all 9.0 and higher submissions** received at least an A+ level seal. While this shouldn't entirely surprise you (because 9.0 is the start of the near mint/mint condition levels), that's pretty fantastic!

Here's the top 10 most submitted games:

| Title                                 | Total Graded | % of Total Graded | Notable Figures                        |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------ | ----------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Pokemon Yellow Version                | 212          | 8.53%             | \*110 Pixelated E Rating               |
| Pokemon Red Version                   | 165          | 6.64%             | \*64 sandshrew screenshot              |
| Pokemon Blue Version                  | 164          | 6.60%             | \*10 red text, 45 sandshrew screenshot |
| Donkey Kong Land III                  | 115          | 4.63%             |                                        |
| Super Mario Land                      | 99           | 3.98%             | \*3 green screenshots                  |
| Dr. Mario                             | 77           | 3.10%             | \*4 3-line warranty                    |
| Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins    | 48           | 1.93%             | 35 non-PC                              |
| The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening | 33           | 1.33%             |                                        |
| Tetris                                | 28           | 1.13%             |                                        |
| Looney Tunes                          | 25           | 1.01%             |                                        |
| Total                                 | 966          | 38.87%            |                                        |

Taking a broader step back from the top 5 games, we'll see that **only 15 out of 426 games contained in Wata's census were submitted 20 or more times**, accounting for **1078 submissions**. In other words, **over 43%** of all submissions account for 15 unique titles!

Let's just say Pokemon is still the king all these years later.

## Game Boy Color

Same as before, let's start with the high level breakdown:

| Seal Grade | Total | %       |
| ---------- | ----- | ------- |
| A++        | 370   | 24.500% |
| A+         | 794   | 52.58%  |
| A          | 282   | 18.67%  |
| B+         | 44    | 2.91%   |
| B          | 18    | 1.19%   |
| C+         | 2     | 0.13%   |
| C          | 0     | 0%      |
| Total      | 1510  | 100%    |

Much like Game Boy, GBC sees a spread with A++ and A+ as focal points:

| Box Grade | A++    | A+     | A     | B+    | B     | C+  | C   |
| --------- | ------ | ------ | ----- | ----- | ----- | --- | --- |
| 9.8       | 95     | 35     | 0     | 1     | 0     | 0   | 0   |
| 9.6       | 109    | 149    | 8     | 1     | 0     | 0   | 0   |
| 9.4       | 75     | 153    | 23    | 2     | 5     | 0   | 0   |
| 9.2       | 40     | 118    | 31    | 6     | 4     | 0   | 0   |
| 9.0       | 19     | 72     | 29    | 3     | 0     | 0   | 0   |
| Total     | 338    | 527    | 91    | 13    | 9     | 0   | 0   |
| %         | 22.38% | 34.90% | 6.03% | 0.86% | 0.60% | 0%  | 0%  |

Here's the top 10 most submitted games. Once again, Pokemon is king with three out of the five titles:

| Title                                   | Total Graded | % of Total Graded | Notable Figures                                                                          |

| Tony Hawk's Pro Skater                  | 42           | 2.78%             |                                                                                          |
| Dragon Ball Z: Legendary Super Warriors | 39           | 2.58%             |                                                                                          |

Similar to its big brother, Game Boy Color only sees 16 titles out of its 255 game library with submissions of 20 or more. In total, **these 16 titles were submitted 731 times**, or **49% of all submissions**.

[See the full list of GBC populations](https://www.watagames.com/populations/gbc/index.html)

## Game Boy Advance

Ever since the initial populations were released (way back in 2021), it was clear GBA has an interesting submission curve similar to its ancestor, the Game Boy. The main difference here is that there are much more A++ seals compared to A.

The high level numbers:

| Seal Grade | Total | %      |
| ---------- | ----- | ------ |
| A++        | 840   | 27.88% |
| A+         | 1624  | 53.90% |
| A          | 432   | 14.34% |
| B+         | 89    | 2.95%  |
| B          | 22    | 0.73%  |
| C+         | 5     | 0.17%  |
| C          | 1     | 0.03%  |
| Total      | 3013  | 100%   |

Break down by seal grades in 9.0 or higher:

| Box Grade | A++    | A+     | A     | B+    | B     | C+    | C   |
| --------- | ------ | ------ | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | --- |
| 9.8       | 269    | 120    | 4     | 0     | 0     | 0     | 0   |
| 9.6       | 218    | 342    | 22    | 4     | 1     | 0     | 0   |
| 9.4       | 171    | 338    | 50    | 9     | 2     | 0     | 0   |
| 9.2       | 79     | 233    | 57    | 4     | 2     | 0     | 0   |
| 9.0       | 44     | 148    | 43    | 6     | 0     | 1     | 0   |
| Total     | 781    | 1181   | 176   | 23    | 5     | 1     | 0   |
| %         | 25.92% | 39.20% | 5.84% | 0.76% | 0.17% | 0.03% | 0%  |

And of course, the top 10 submitted games should surprise no one:

| Title                                                   | Total Graded | % of Total Graded | Notable Figures                          |

| Pokemon Ruby Version                                    | 57           | 1.89%             |                                          |

Interestingly, there are a couple dozen games in the top 50 that exceed 20 submissions each. There's simply a wider spread of popular games, it would seem.

Considering video games as a whole have only became more popular over time, especially by this era, it makes sense there would be more desirable games to submit.

Unfortunately, no single GBA game pulls a triple-digit submission number.

## General conclusions

If we're to take these numbers at face value, even considering the variance of seal grade within a single seal grade option, people seem to have generally submitted good condition games more often than not. Which makes sense! After all, the grade is largely what drives a higher price in these markets, and collectors like to have nice examples.

Next we'll look at NES, SNES, and N64. Stay tuned!\
\
**(09/08/2022) Correction**: Official Game Boy population data and resulting percentages have been corrected to show the correct submission count at **2485**.

**(09/17/2022) Update**: Expanded the "top submitted" games for each platform to 10 games, including notable figures for select games.
