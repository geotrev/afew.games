title: Seal Grades Are Here for Wata Graded Games
description: A quick look into what the new data means and how it changes rarity
---
It's finally here! Almost a year after Wata released its initial population data for box grades, Wata has not only updated the census (as of August 1st, 2022), but added seal grades simply by hovering on a given grade.

Here's the statement (August 17th, 2022):

> **Population Reports update**
>
> You’ve been asking, and we’ve finally got them – seal ratings have been added to our Population Reports! We’ve been working hard the last few months to build and accurately represent this critical aspect of our pop reports. Now all populations can display the seal-rating breakdown for each box grade by hovering over the population count. [Pop reports are now updated](http://links.collectors.mkt5064.com/els/v2/XNZqSE4rXmsP/dTBDL25NY0VZZkVaQm9JejdwTU1PS1NURlg0K2hHVGo5SFF5MGY4ZG5PTS9NNHdHNXlPVVVvUGZpZWM5WEk4RW5mczRsSW9BNncwbzlLdThRdTNnSWYra3IwR0ZEcngwaVp1QWpPL0dXT2c9S0/) for all listed systems through August 1, 2022!

While it's not news at this point, being almost a full month late, I did want to share some interesting data I've compiled for a few consoles and their games.

- - -

An important caveat to all of this information: it's largely driven by human behavior - meaning the games submitted are prone to interest and nostalgia, and people are likely prone to submitting games of better condition.

For these reasons alone, it's worth saying that **this data is not representative of the larger game supply**.

To start, let's take a look at seal grades for Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance.

## Game Boy

Here's a high level view of all seal grades:

| Seal Grade | Total | %      |
| ---------- | ----- | ------ |
| A++        | 511   | 25.87% |
| A+         | 1177  | 59.59% |
| A          | 600   | 30.37% |
| B+         | 140   | 0.07%  |
| B          | 39    | 0.01%  |
| C+         | 14    | 0.007% |
| C          | 4     | 0.002% |
| Total      | 1975  | 100%   |

When we break down seal grades for box grades at 9.0 and higher, the patterns are clearer, but not entirely surprising:

| Box Grade | A++    | A+     | A      | B+    | B     | C+  | C   |
| --------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ----- | ----- | --- | --- |
| 9.8       | 165    | 53     | 4      | 0     | 0     | 0   | 0   |
| 9.6       | 124    | 202    | 49     | 5     | 1     | 0   | 0   |
| 9.4       | 103    | 254    | 64     | 10    | 1     | 0   | 0   |
| 9.2       | 47     | 172    | 74     | 11    | 5     | 0   | 0   |
| 9.0       | 29     | 130    | 67     | 11    | 2     | 0   | 0   |
| Total     | 468    | 811    | 258    | 37    | 9     | 0   | 0   |
| %         | 23.67% | 41.06% | 13.06% | 1.87% | 0.45% | 0%  | 0%  |

Here's the top five most submitted games:

| Title                  | Total Submitted (out of 1975) | %   |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------- | --- |
| Pokémon Yellow Version | 212                           | 11% |
| Pokémon Red Version    | 165                           | 8%  |
| Pokémon Blue Version   | 164                           | 8%  |
| Donkey Kong Land III   | 115                           | 6%  |
| Super Mario Land       | 99                            | 5%  |
| Total                  | 755                           | 38% |

Even more interesting is that **only 15 out of 426 games were submitted more than 20 times**, accounting for **1078 submissions** in this sub-category. In other words, **54%** of all submissions account for 15 unique titles.

## Game Boy Advance

Ever since the initial populations were released (way back in 2021), it was clear GBA has an interesting submission curve similar to its ancestor, the Game Boy. The main difference here is that there are much more A++ seals compared to A.

The high level numbers:

| Seal Grade | Total | %      |
| ---------- | ----- | ------ |
| A++        | 840   | 27.88% |
| A+         | 1624  | 53.90% |
| A          | 432   | 14.34% |
| B+         | 89    | 2.95%  |
| B          | 22    | 0.73%  |
| C+         | 5     | 0.16%  |
| C          | 1     | 0.03%  |
| Total      | 3013  | 100%   |

Break down by seal grades in 9.0 or higher:

| Box Grade | A++ | A+  | A   | B+  | B   | C+  | C   |
| --------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 9.8       | 269 | 120 | 4   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   |
| 9.6       | 218 | 342 | 22  | 4   | 1   | 0   | 0   |
| 9.4       | 171 | 338 | 50  | 9   | 2   | 0   | 0   |
| 9.2       | 79  | 233 | 57  | 4   | 2   | 0   | 0   |
| 9.0       | 44  | 148 | 43  | 6   | 0   | 1   | 0   |
| Total     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |

And of course, the top five submitted games:

The spread of submitted games in the top 50 (of 3013) is gradual, unlike Game Boy. While I wouldn't say there were more popular games on GBA vs. GB by measure of this number, it certainly makes it interesting. Video games as a whole became more popular by this era, so it makes sense!

## Nintendo 64

Another personal favorite and one I thought had some interesting data. To start, the high level of seal grade totals:
