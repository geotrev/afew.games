Video games, even today in their physical forms, are updated in minuscule ways during the lifetime of their production. *Pocket Monsters* is no different.

The early days of the franchise required some discrete changes that set apart these games from later prints.

This post is the first part in a multi-essay series dedicated to Pocket Monsters. In this first entry, we'll cover the games to start it all: *Red* and *Green* versions!

> *NOTE: This post is supplemental to the database. To see a list of first generation* Pocket Monsters *print variants as they exist on A Few Games, [view them here](https://www.afew.games/?search=pocket+monsters&platform=game+boy). A full list of sources can be found at the end of this post.*

## Pocket Monsters: Green & Red

![Pocket Monsters: Red & Green, front and back](/uploads/red-green-hero.jpg)

Given they were the first games to release for the franchise in February 1996, *Green* and *Red* have some complex data behind them. The games themselves were prone to bugs, and multiple prints happened before the design settled near the end of 1996 in time for *Blue* version, then later in 1998 for *Yellow* version.

With the help of packaging references, official *Nintendo* interviews, and production data, here is a breakdown of the very early days of *Pocket Monsters: Red & Green* as a physical game.

To start, it's worth noting *Red* and *Green* had identical contents for the duration of their lifespan.

### Box

Early versions of at both *Red* and *Green* version had larger UPC barcodes compared to later prints.

### Contents

A few key components are important when identifying first production examples, particularly on the cartridge and the inclusion of a feedback survey postcard.

The only generic inserts included were the *Super Game Boy* ad and a yellow link cable explainer. The map was included with every print of the game. All copies would additional include a fold-out map of the Kanto region and the manual.

#### R﻿ed Version

### Cartridge

All Game Boy cartridges have a code stamped onto the label.

> *NOTE: Other label codes may have been manufactured in parallel, but that's unclear at this time.*

Here is a confirmed example of a first-production copy of *Green* version.

![Pocket Monsters: Green with sticker code '00'](/uploads/screenshot-2024-01-09-at-8.56.16-pm.png)

A *Red* or *Green* cartridge from the true first print runs will have a **strictly numerical** code stamped onto the cartridge sticker.

> *NOTE: There are unconfirmed reports of no code cartridges, but historically these have been an indication of a reproduction cartridge. Should evidence emerge to validate those reports, this post will be updated to reflect it*

[Mask ROM](https://handwiki.org/wiki/Mask_ROM) date codes coinciding with the below label codes suggest they were among the very first manufactured:

* *Green* label code: `00`
* *Red* label code: `22`

A look at the circuit boards of *Green* and *Red* indicate they were produced a few months before the launch of the game (in the below example, that's in November, 1995). The soldered chips were produced a little bit later in this case in the fourth or fifth week of 1996 (component date codes: `9605` and `9604`; `96` is the year and `05`/`04` is the week).

According to sources, *Red* would receive a `00` stamp code as well, but this was well after the initial release period (late April into May 1996).

Sometime before November 1996, the revisions `00A` (*Green*) and `22A` (*Red*) were printed for the `1.1` software version, which would also be the sole revision used on *Blue* version (released in December of the same year).

Here's a translated reference on which label codes can be found on *Red*, *Green*, *Blue*, and *Yellow* versions, as gathered by folks in the Japanese collecting/gaming communities (source linked at the end of this post):

#### Survey

Another document included in the earliest printings is a feedback survey postcard, only available during the first 30 days after release, and had to be postmarked by the end of March. Customers would be entered into a free raffle for the official guidebook or special playing cards, as well as an additional copy of either *Red* or *Green* version.

An interesting fact to consider is that Ishihara-san, President & CEO of *Game Freak,* [indicated](https://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/ds/pokemon/0/0/) in an interview that initial sales were lower than expected during the first 30 days, which explains why these surveys are relatively scarce today.

![Feedback survey, front](/uploads/survey-front.png)

The front of the postcard translates to roughly the following:

> *Kyoto City Higashiyama Post Office P.O. Box No. 15*
>
> *Thank you for purchasing Pocket Monsters. Sorry to trouble you, we request your opinion as valuable reference for future software.*
>
> *Additionally, a lottery will be run for participants. Winners may receive:*
>
> * *(100 Winners) Pocket Monsters Guidebook*
> * *(500 Winners) Special Playing Cards*
>
> *In addition, the announcement of the winner will receive a free copy of either version. This is valid until the end of March, 1996.*

The bottom box (featuring *Bulbasaur)* in the survey (roughly) reads:

> *It's all about Pocket Monsters!*
>
> *"Pocket Monsters Guidebook"*
>
> *– List price undecided –*
>
> *Scheduled to be released early March, 1996.*

This text lines up perfectly for the late February release of the games.

Sources also also tell me that the surveys uniformly use the *Red* model part number for its code. That's to say, they will include this code at the bottom: `DMG-APAJ-JPN` (where `APAJ` is the Red designation). A *Green* version code has yet to be uncovered for the postcard.

And of course, here is the other (informational) side customers would fill out:

I hope this dive down history lane was fun! It makes for an interesting hunt when you can find the most obscure, early prints of these otherwise abundant games.
