*This post is supplemental to the database. To see a list of first generation* Pocket Monsters *print variants as they exist on A Few Games, [view them here](https://www.afew.games/?search=pocket+monsters&platform=game+boy). A full list of sources can be found at the end of this post.*

This shouldn't be new to anyone, but it's worth stating off the bat: video games, even today in their physical forms, are updated in minuscule ways during the lifetime of their production. *Pocket Monsters* is no different. *Game Freak*, despite developing the biggest franchise in the world, is still somewhat scrappy compared to other AAA studios. Hopefully this information helps illuminate that *Game Freak* has always been this way – especially in the beginning.

## Pocket Monsters: Green & Red

![Pocket Monsters: Red & Green, front and back](/uploads/red-green-hero.jpg)

Given they were the first games to release for the franchise in February 1996, *Green* and *Red* have some complex data behind them. The games themselves were prone to bugs, and multiple prints happened before the design settled near the end of 1996 in time for *Blue* version, and later in 1998, *Yellow* version.

With the help of packaging, interviews, and production data, here are the early days of *Pocket Monsters: Red & Green*.

### Initial Release

Red and Green had identical contents for the duration of their lifespan.

#### Box

The main point to draw attention to is the barcode on the back. Early versions of at both *Red* and *Green* version were larger than later prints.

#### Contents

A few key components are important when identifying a first production example, particularly the cartridge and a survey postcard.

The only generic inserts included were the *Super Game Boy* and link cable ads. The map was included with every print of the game.

F﻿or up front reference, here are the two versions in question.

##### **G﻿reen Version**

##### **R﻿ed Version**

##### **Cartridge**

All Game Boy cartridges have a code stamped onto the sticker. Here is an example of an early, if not first production copy of *Green* version:

![Pocket Monsters: Green with sticker code 20A](/uploads/screenshot-2024-01-09-at-8.56.16-pm.png)

A *Red* or *Green* cartridge from the true first print runs will have a **strictly numerical** code stamped onto the cartridge sticker. There are unconfirmed reports of no code cartridges, but historically these have been an indication of a reproduction cartridge. Should evidence emerge to validate those reports, this post will be updated to reflect it.

[Mask ROM](https://handwiki.org/wiki/Mask_ROM) date codes for the following production codes on Green and Red suggest they were among the very first manufactured, and should be in the earliest productions of the game:

* *Green*: `00`
* *Red*: `22`

According to sources, Red would receive a `00` stamp code, but this was well after the initial release period (late April into May 1996). Sometime before November 1996, the revisions `00A` (*Green*) and `22A` (*Red*) were printed for the `1.1` software version, which would also be the sole revision used on *Blue* version (released at the end of the same year).

Here's a translated reference on which production codes can be found on various copies of *Red*, *Green*, *Blue*, and *Yellow* versions, as gathered by folks in the Japanese collecting/gaming communities:

##### **Survey**

The most obvious indicator in the earliest printings is a survey insert only available during the first 30 days after release, and had to be postmarked by the end of March.

Ishihara-san, President & CEO of *Game Freak,* [indicated](https://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/ds/pokemon/0/0/) in an interview that initial sales were lower than expected during the first 30 days, which explains why these surveys are relatively scarce today.

![Feedback survey, front](/uploads/survey-front.png)

It translates to roughly the following:

> *Kyoto City Higashiyama Post Office P.O. Box No. 15*
>
> *Thank you for purchasing Pocket Monsters. Sorry to trouble you, we request your opinion as valuable reference for future software.*
>
> *Additionally, a lottery will be run for participants. Winners may receive:*
>
> * *(100 Winners) Pocket Monsters Guidebook*
> * *(500 Winners) Special Playing Cards*
>
> *In addition, the announcement of the winner will receive a free copy of either version. This is valid until the end of March, 1996.*

The bottom box (featuring *Bulbasaur)* in the survey (roughly) reads:

> *It's all about Pocket Monsters!*
>
> *"Pocket Monsters Guidebook"*
>
> *– List price undecided –*
>
> *Scheduled to be released early March, 1996.*

This text lines up perfectly for the late February release of the games.

And of course, here is the information side customers fill out:

Fun fact: Sources tell me that the surveys always have a *Red* production code. That's to say, they have a production code of `DMG-APAJ-JPN`, where APAJ is the *Red* version code.

I hope this dive down history lane was helpful! It makes for a fun collecting hunt when you can find the most obscure, early prints of these extremely common games. Best of luck in your search!
