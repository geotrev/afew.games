title: "The Review Is In: Does Wata's New Graded Holder Live Up To Expectations?"
description: After two long months, here's a detailed breakdown of the new features
---
As soon as April 24th hit, I submitted six games to Wata in a reholder order. At the time, I felt quite starry eyed, as the new holder seems to address many of the form factor & design concerns that plagued the legacy holder.

For context, I also published [a short explainer](/essays/review-new-wata-games-holder-design) on those new holders and what to expect.

Here are the games I submitted in a range of sizes:

Of note, I didn't submit the larger Turbografx or smaller PlayStation Vita size as I didn't have any to submit.

## Quick Preface

Before we dive into the full review, I wanted to share some personal thoughts with y'all.

I've waited about two full months for my return (yes, you read that correctly). In the time I've waited for my reholder to return, I'm afraid to report that the customer & product quality service issues that plagued Wata before the Collector's acquisition seem to be crawling back.

By this, I mean I've seen several accounts of games damaged in the new holders. This community is miniscule compared to [other categories, like trading cards](https://www.afew.games/uploads/screenshot_20230501-232624_twitter.jpg), which makes this type of damage concerning. With PSA, who churns out over a million cards per month, I can expect a few mistakes to fall throught he cracks. At Wata though, I would expect better than what I see.

To make matters worse, Collector's laid off their marketing department across subsidiaries, including Wata, a short time after the reholder launch. I don't blame Wata for this, but I think this could be a contributing factor. *(Opinion)* Wide ranging layoffs appear to reduce morale and quality for service suffers as a result. *(End opinion)*

Personally, I've experienced some inexcusable customer service that I won't dive too deep into now, including the enormous wait time (I saw folks get their reholder orders back in weeks, how is that possible?!).

All I'll say is, I hope they can figure out what is plaguing the new holder (inner blister probably) and resolve the bizarrely inconsistent turnaround between customers in the same submission tier. It's very discouraging, and I had serious anxiety waiting for my games!

Without further ado, let's discuss the new holder!

## Sized to fit

From my view, the best part about the new design is the wider array of prefabricated sizes. It's most noticeable when looking at the games from the side:

Overall, I find the more concise use of space refreshing, with the exception of Vita, Switch, and DS (we'll get to that later).

In particular the more streamlined Jewel case & 3DS holder is much appreciated. They begin to rival VGA in their sleekness.

As mentioned, the two outliers in the current equation (that I can physically show) are DS and Switch. Both appear to reuse a holder similar or identical in size, that better fit other games.

For instance, the DS holder appears to use the same size holder that fits Game Boy games:

See that extra space? It's a bit unfortunate. You would think there woudl be one holder size to fit DS, 3DS, and Jewel case together since DS is only slightly deeper than 3DS! Oh well.

And for Switch, it appears to use a holder that is slightly shorter, but somehow slightly deeper, compared to the DVD holder (it's hard to notice, though). Switch in particular feels like it needs a size of its own.

From the top, it's nothing special. There's nothing there.

## New, sleeker label



## Inside the holder

You might not be surprised to learn that the blister from the legacy holder is retained. I've already stated in previous writings that I dislike this feature, particularly the corners. Similarly, I mentioned there are new issues plaguing recent orders to Wata involving damaged games. Most of those issues are the result of these blisters seemingly getting warped inside the holder.

Here's one from Video Game Sage that illustrates what I mean:

![External example of a new holder with collapsed inner blister, from bottom](/uploads/image.jpeg.bd90bd940877cd68f65e2db852c71436.jpeg)

*Notice the bottom is missing? The game should "float" inside.*

Upon further investigation, I found an eBay listing that might be from this same forum member, with more pictures of the damage. It looks like something caused the bottom to collapse. Could have been from shipping, although I can't be positive.

## Final thoughts

Overall, the new design is much nicer *looking*, but time will tell if additional changes are needed to improve its durability and resilience to inner blister damage. I'm grateful my games are in good shape and no additional help is needed.

The new label is much better, as well. If you compare the legacy label to the new one, the legacy label has a slight beige tint to it. Kinda weird! but I'm glad the new one is completely gray and easy to read. Also, the certification number has moved to the front, which makes it easier to get that info if needed.

Only bummers on the label are the grading date is no longer displayed on the back and the scan code is gone in favor of a regular UPC-style scan bar. My guess is to streamline the use of space and make way for the maybe, maybe-not app to scan your game (which was promised to release just a few years ago).

What do you think of it? I'd love to hear how folks are experiencing this new holder and if it scratches that itch for a nicer design and less shelf space taken up by the legacy holder!
