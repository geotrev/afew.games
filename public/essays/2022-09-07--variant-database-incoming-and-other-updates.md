title: Variant Database Incoming and Other Updates!

  collection page is too long

In the last few months, I've compiled more databases of game prints; one database for each game, specifically. This info has been super useful when trying to determine which print came first, especially. I've also taken the time to rewrite my collection page so it's now faster and can collapse by grader section.

That said, there are a couple things I plan to do to improve data availability from this website  in relation to both variant data and my collection page.

## Variants Database

The days of simple databases in Notion are coming to a close for me. I'm going to need something more robust for my use-case, and something more connected that doesn't require dumping + reformatting my lists repeatedly every couple months to this website.

[Since the last time I dumped several modern Nintendo game variants](https://www.afew.games/essays/a-random-ntsc-u-c-modern-nintendo-game-variant-list), my variant lists on Notion have been my go-to. While it hasn't slowed to a crawl per se, it's not ideal.  

Soon I'll add a database archive of all these variants available right from this website. Anytime I need to record a game and its prints, I'll do so here. In that sense, it will be dynamic.

## Collection Reorganization

My collection page served its purpose initially when I didn't have many games; simply throwing them up in two piles: one VGA, and one Wata, was OK at the time.

Having amassed more games lately (and many more on the way from Wata), I need to think in smaller buckets. Soon it will be re-divided by console, with the grader intermixed in each. It'll make my games much easier to track query going forward

Until then, the sections can now collapse and expand using the small control on the top right of each list. The search will be the best way to navigate it until that's changed.

Thanks for reading and I look forward to sharing more of data with y'all soon!
