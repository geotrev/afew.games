title: Things holding back video game grading
description: "Like many other collecting categories, the last few years has seen
  a massive boom in graded video games. Is it all it appears to be, though? "

Take a walk with me down memory lane, friend. For as long as video games have existed, there have been people who collect them. Like many items historical or antiquitous in nature, video games have a facet of art culture (even if not originally intended to be so). Games we love, games that bring back memories, widely accepted "icons" of the gaming world, and rare games that only show up every blue moon at a garage sale or pawn shop and the seller "had no idea what it was worth." 

No matter the case, it should be somewhat obvious that games were eventually going to enter the collecting world at eye-popping values.

While that seems great and fun, there have been a lot of old and continued bumps in the road for the graded games hobby. With great value and no market regulation, comes great risk and loss.

But first, how did we get here? Let's take a brief look at the timeline.

## History Lesson

Like coins and comics before, the idea of "grading" and "authenticating" a video game by a third party service entered in the late 2000s by [VGA](https://cgagrading.com/) (Video Game Authority). For a small fee, you can send you game to their offices and have your sealed games confirmed as factory authentic (or unsealed, but new contents, also referred to as "Qualified").

Up until about 2018, VGA operated essentially without competition in the market. That was until Wata Games came around, with a parternship with Heritage Auctions (one of the largest auction houses in the USA), to rebrand the category of rare, sealed, and desirable games.

A few press releases later (notably, the [$100,000 sale](https://mashable.com/article/super-mario-bros-auction-record) of a 2nd print Super Mario Bros for NES), suddenly there seemed to be this understanding that games might be highly desirable and therefore worth a lot depending on the buyer (and how many compete at auction).

Skip ahead another two years, and a Super Mario 64 sells for 1.56M, and then another [Super Mario bros early print sells for $2M](https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/7/22614450/unopened-copy-super-mario-bros-sells-2-million-record) in a private sale (announced by the seller, Rally).

Since then, the market has been on a decline (along with the rest of the USA economy), [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvLFEh7V18A) after [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKbuNwS-gaI&t=1s) after video has been made claiming market manipulation and fraud, and collectors within the community deny and accept these issues depending on who you talk to.

Remember, this is only a brief overview of important events. A lot of other things happened here that I ignored, mainly because I want to stress the fact that the hobby has "grown" (at least, in the monetary sense) in the multiple thousands of percent in a very short period of time (since 2018). This growth has come with it many pain points, not at all helped by the fact the COVID-19 pandemic largely inflated the prices of all collecting categories, starting in 2020, all the way through 2021.

## The Best Parts

With the history side covered, let's jump into some of the cool parts of the collecting hobby.

For starters, probably the coolest parts of the hobby are the chase and the community.

### The Chase

Have you ever opened a pack of trading cards? What about those lottery machines or scratchoffs? If you've done anything in the world of "playing with luck," you know what I'm talking about.

Grading a collectible, in some ways, works like this, although the more experienced you are the less likely you are to be surprised. That said, sending a game in for grading is very exciting for condition-snobs (like myself). Knowing you have a very mint copy of your favorite games is a big rush, and makes you feel good! It can also help that there might be some value involved, although it isn't always a requirement if you're mainly focused on intrinsic value.

The grading process can be incredibly anxiety-provoking, but fun. I've been through it many times, myself, and have always enjoyed the final result.

### The Community
