title: The 1000 Cuts in Graded Video Games
description: "As exciting and lucrative as graded games might be "
---
Take a walk with me down memory lane, friend. For as long as video games have existed, there have been people who collect them. Like many items historical or antiquitous in nature, video games have a facet of art culture (even if not originally intended to be so). Games we love, games that bring back memories, widely accepted "icons" of the gaming world, and rare games that only show up every blue moon at a garage sale or pawn shop and the seller "had no idea what it was worth." 

No matter the case, it should be somewhat obvious that games were eventually going to enter the collecting world at eye-popping values.

While that seems great and fun, there have been a lot of old and continued bumps in the road for the graded games hobby. With great value and no market regulation, comes great risk and loss.

But first, how did we get here? Let's take a brief look at the timeline.

## History Lesson

Like coins and comics before, the idea of "grading" and "authenticating" a video game by a third party service entered in the late 2000s by [VGA](https://cgagrading.com/) (Video Game Authority). For a small fee, you can send you game to their offices and have your sealed games confirmed as factory authentic (or unsealed, but new contents, also referred to as "Qualified").

Up until about 2018, VGA operated essentially without competition in the market. That was until Wata Games came around, with a partnership with Heritage Auctions (one of the largest auction houses in the USA), to rebrand the category of rare, sealed, and desirable games.

A few press releases later (notably, the [$100,000 sale](https://mashable.com/article/super-mario-bros-auction-record) of a 2nd print Super Mario Bros for NES), suddenly there seemed to be this understanding that games might be highly desirable and therefore worth a lot depending on the buyer (and how many compete at auction).

Skip ahead another two years, and a Super Mario 64 sells for 1.56M, and then another [Super Mario bros early print sells for $2M](https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/7/22614450/unopened-copy-super-mario-bros-sells-2-million-record) in a private sale (announced by the seller, Rally).

Since then, the market has been on a decline (along with the rest of the USA economy), [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvLFEh7V18A) after [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKbuNwS-gaI&t=1s) after video has been made claiming market manipulation and fraud, and collectors within the community deny and accept these issues depending on who you talk to.

Remember, this is only a brief overview of important events. A lot of other things happened here that I ignored, mainly because I want to stress the fact that the hobby has "grown" (at least, in the monetary sense) in the multiple thousands of percent in a very short period of time (since 2018). This growth has come with it many pain points, not at all helped by the fact the COVID-19 pandemic largely inflated the prices of all collecting categories, starting in 2020, all the way through 2021.

## The Best Parts

With the history side covered, let's jump into some of the cool parts of the collecting hobby.

For starters, probably the coolest parts of the hobby are the chase and the community.

### The Chase

Have you ever opened a pack of trading cards? What about those lottery machines or scratchoffs? If you've done anything in the world of "playing with luck," you know what I'm talking about.

Grading a collectible, in some ways, works like this, although the more experienced you are the less likely you are to be surprised. That said, sending a game in for grading is very exciting for condition-snobs (like myself). Knowing you have a very mint copy of your favorite games is a big rush, and makes you feel good! It can also help that there might be some value involved, although it isn't always a requirement if you're mainly focused on intrinsic value.

The grading process can be incredibly anxiety-provoking, but fun. I've been through it many times, myself, and have always enjoyed the final result.

### The Community

Another fantastic aspect to collecting is the people in the space. While not wholly diverse (read: mostly men), it's an enjoyable scene with a lot of personality. Special shout out to the SACK community (run by [GetTheGregGames](https://www.youtube.com/c/GetTheGregGames) on YouTube). He streams most of the major auctions nowadays and is even sponsored by Heritage Auctions directly. Plus, the Discord server is a lot of fun.

A lesser-talked about aspect to collecting is you often run into people who collect more than just your interest area. For instance, many of the same folks collecting games, also collect cards and comics.

## The Worst Parts

There's never good without the bad, and video games are no exception.

Many of my personal complaints in graded games start as high up as the grading companies themselves, and to a smaller extent, some individuals in the community.

### The Grading Companies

Both Wata and VGA have shown disappointing flaws in either the service or product. In either case, I can't honestly recommend collectors send in their games to be graded. 

### Wata Games

With Wata, I've seen a lot of issues mainly centered around quality control, and to a more serious extent, the holder itself damaging games. In terms of quality control, games have been auctioned with hair or bugs (yes, bugs) sealed in the holder, and you might get your game back with a low-ink label or with a grade that's off center/tilted. Puts a sour taste in my mouth knowing I waited possibly months just to request a reholder.

Similarly, the inner plastic liner has been seen to damage games in some cases; mainly titles on Game Boy where the sharp corners get pushed in. On DVD games, if a cardboard slip-on sleeve is there, it has a chance of being crushed because of the tight fit.

Note that the above is not an attack on Wata as much as a report on the claims I've seen in the community. Thankfully, Wata has acknowledged at least the modern slip-on sleeve issue and now informs customers that the encapulsation process requires removal of the sleeve.

### VGA

VGAs issues rest mainly in a history of poor communication and reduction in services. Over the 15 years or so of business, where VGA started with population reports and an online submission process both available, both have been retired. Online submissions went south when flash support got nuked by modern browsers, and the population data, well, who knows why that's gone. 

And here lays the second issue: communication. Customers have been told for 10 years that a new website was coming, with a better submission process and population data. Well, it's 2022, and the new website is here. Sadly, we still have neither of those things.

### The Value

While it might seem the value is more of a positive, and generally it is, there are certainly issues that arise from increased value.

Namely, participants in the market looking to profit as much as possible, and some going to fraudulent lengths to do so. Reseals are even more common now than they were in recent years.

I plan to discuss in a future essay on how to tell when a game is authentic, but for the sake of this explanation, let's just say it can be hard to want to participate in the hobby when all the ebay listings are astronomically high, and you'll need to get your hands dirty with 1-on-1 negotation to grab your favorite games (because chances are, they're everyone else's favorites, too!)

- - -

At the end of the day, the issues are clear as day. The two "trusted" grading outlets have severe flaws and there's still only the two options for the bulk of the market (not including less popular or non-USA companies, which could be another discussion, perhaps).

## Looking Ahead

All said and done, what is coming next? Well, as mentioned above, VGA's new website is live, and although it doesn't have all the things promised over the years, it's a step in the right direction. Similarly, Wata's acquisition by CU has seen some great benefits. Turnaround times are better than ever and with added resourcing, we're likely to see improvements as customers voice the concerns I mentioned.

And even better, competitors are entering the market every day. CGC is slated to start accepting games for grading in the later trimester this year, which will serve greatly to add some much needed competition in the market.

There's also been a lot of visibility on this market in recent years, which is also a huge plus. Both for market growth and for normalization of the hobby. A great example of this is YouTube channels like [Reserved Investments](https://www.youtube.com/c/ReservedInvestments), which helps to bring expectations of the hobby back down to Earth while showcasing the market's potential.

Ultimately, I hope your takeaway here isn't dread for the future of graded video games. Rather, it's to see there is much room for improvement, and ultimately we're in no rush to send off our games anyway, right? I choose to vote with my wallet, so when the time is right, I'll likely send my games off to be graded too.
