title: "Pocket Monsters: First Generation Print Variant Breakdown"
description: A visual guide to the print variants of Pocket Monsters Red, Green,
  Blue, and Yellow
---
When you received your first copy of Pokemon for Nintendo Game Boy, where were you? Some folks got it as a present or at the store, in its physical sealed box. Some folks received just a cartridge. I received my first Pokemon game, Blue version, as a hand-me-down from my sister. I later would receive Yellow version as a Christmas present. Still one of my favorite Christmas's of all time!

What makes these experiences unique isn't only the momentary snapshot in our personal lives when we first experienced the games, but also the actual printed version of the game we received. Believe it or not, 

This shouldn't be new to anyone, but it's worth clarifying: video games, even in their static physical form, are frequently updated in new printed batches during the lifetime of its production. The idea of a game being updated directly by the developer is a relatively new evolution – only the last 15-20 years or so have we had that capability, out of the 50 years of home gaming.

What this post aims to do is shed light on the known print variations of Pocket Monsters: *Green*, *Red*, Blue, & Yellow, starting from their initial release, up through final printings.

## Pocket Monsters Green & Red

<front and back of red and green>

*Green* and *Red* have some of the most complex variations as they were the first, starting in February 1996. The games themselves were prone to bugs, and multiple print changes happened before the design settled near the end of 1996 in time for *Blue*, and later, *Yellow*.

### Initial Release

The initial release of *Green* and *Red* version had some unique differences, both on the box and the inserts. For the purposes of this post, *Green* version will be the primary reference as the same information applies to both, however exceptions or missing information will be noted as appropriate.

#### Box

The main point to draw attention to is the barcode on the back. Early versions of at least *Green* version had a larger barcode.

For comparison, a first print box:

Compared to subsequent printings:

Unfortunately, not enough evidence exists to suggest Red version also had a large barcode for its first printing, but it's certainly possible.

#### Contents

Next, let's draw attention to the inside of the box. Almost every piece is important to determine a proper first production copy.

#### Cartridge

A *Red* or *Green* cartridge from the true first (or early) printings of the game will have either no code at all, or a strictly numerical code stamped onto the cartridge sticker. Here is an example of a mid- to late-production cartridge with the code `20A`:

![Pocket Monsters: Green with sticker code 20A](/uploads/2b19157b-8cc9-4173-a8f1-c803291829fc.jpeg)

Here's a translated reference on which codes are likely to be found on the earliest copies of *Red*, *Green*, *Blue*, and *Yellow* versions:

#### Inserts

The next important indicator is the earliest printings have an initial release survey insert. All other early printings also contain a Super Game Boy ad, but that isn't specific to the very first printings.

##### Survey

The initial release survey was included for the very first round of the games at retail.

![Initial release survey request](/uploads/screenshot-2024-01-07-at-11.51.46-am.png)

It translates to roughly the following:

> Kyoto City Higashiyama Post Office P.O. Box No. 15
>
> Thank you for purchasing Pocket Monsters. Sorry to trouble you, we request your opinion as valuable reference for future software in this questionnaire.
>
> A lottery will be run for those who participate. Winners may receive:
>
> * 100 Winners: Pocket Monsters Guidebook
> * 500 Winners: Special Playing Cards
>
> In addition, the announcement of the winner will receive a free copy. This is valid until the end of March 1996.

The game released in February of that year, so the 1-month deadline was for the earliest copies only.

The bottom box featuring Bulbasaur in the survey (roughly) reads:

> It's all about Pocket Monsters!
>
> "Pocket Monsters Guidebook"
>
> –List price undecided–
>
> Scheduled to be released early March, 1996.

## Pocket Monsters: Blue

<front and back of blue>

*Blue* version is unique for a few reasons. First, it started the first of a "sealed bag" traditional that would continue through *Crystal* version. It also was the first and only game to have a mail order launch, before finally hitting retail proper.

Initial release included the plastic bag with a barcode.

![Pocket Monsters Blue version, front](/uploads/0974ad5b-68c4-41ee-abdb-89a2d7bdba19.jpeg)

The box itself had no barcode.

Retail versions would follow with barcode, similar to *Red* and *Green*.

*Blue* version also ended up having a Toyota AUTO promotion that featured a unique box printing, along with a tin box that is still unclear in its purpose with the game itself. Probably contains accessories, but hard to say without more direct evidence.

It's also unclear *when* that promotion occurred.

## Pocket Monsters: Yellow

<front and back of Yellow>

Just as *Blue* was substantially simpler in its printings than *Red* and *Green* before it as the designs settled, Yellow proves even simpler with two distinct printings.

The box design, however, never changed from its original printed version.

To start, its 24-hour pre-release version came in a sealed bag with post cards, the cards being the first time such an addition was included.

The game box and contents have no differences from this version apart from the sealed bag with post cards. Given the date on this flyer advertising one day before release (9/11), it's enough to note the distinct variant.

There is one documented copy of this pre-release *Yellow* version that was graded by VGA, as well. It came sealed in the bag, so VGA denoted it as "uncirculated."

## Hardware ads

Once *Red*, *Green*, and *Blue* had all been released by August 1996, only a few minor changes occurred to the packaging. Mainly, the inclusion of new cartridge stamp codes (see above) and ads for Game Boy Pocket, Game Boy Camera, Game Boy Color, and N64 to showcase the newest Nintendo had to offer for players.

These ad inserts would also become present in both Blue and Yellow versions, as the new game & hardware release schedules allowed for revisions.

> **\*Note:** This is not intended to showcase print order, rather just some of the other inserts as the games aged while reprints occurred through the late 1990s. A more thorough examination of these inserts is needed to know when they appeared and with revision history.*

### Hardware ads
