*The information below is largely sourced from **[Mikaifu Collection](https://www.instagram.com/mikaifucollection/)** and **Thaane** (*GetTheGregGames*' Discord server). To see a list of first generation* Pocket Monsters *video game variants as they exist in AFG's database, [view them here](https://www.afew.games/?search=pocket+monsters&platform=game+boy). This post is therefore supplemental information.*

This shouldn't be new to anyone, but it's worth stating off the bat: video games, even today in their physical forms, are updated in minuscule ways during the lifetime of their production. 

*Pocket Monsters* is no different. *Game Freak*, despite its presence for the biggest franchise in the world, is still somewhat scrappy compared to the other AAA studios. Hopefully this information helps illuminate that *Game Freak* has always been this way – especially in the beginning.

## Pocket Monsters: Green & Red

![Pocket Monsters: Green and Red versions, front and back](/uploads/red-green-hero.jpg)

Given they were the first games to release for the franchise in February 1996, *Green* and *Red* they have some complex data behind them. The games themselves were prone to bugs, and multiple prints happened before the design settled near the end of 1996 in time for *Blue* version, and later in 1998, *Yellow* version.

With the help of packaging, interviews, and production data, here are the early days of *Pocket Monsters: Red & Green*.

### Initial Release

For the purposes of this section, *Green* version will be the primary reference as most of the information applies to both, however exceptions or missing information will be noted as appropriate.

#### Box

The main point to draw attention to is the barcode on the back. Early versions of at both *Red* and *Green* version were larger than later prints.

![Second print box with smaller barcode](/uploads/screenshot-2024-01-07-at-11.54.26-am.png)

#### Contents

A few key components are important when identifying a first production example, particularly the cartridge and the initial survey insert to field feedback from early customers.

![Full contents of a first-print of Green version ](/uploads/4fa07721-40c5-4449-9303-7871e19aa5be.jpeg)

The only generic inserts included were the *Super Game Boy* and link cable ads.

##### **Cartridge**

All Game Boy cartridges have a code stamped onto the sticker. Here is an example of a mid- to late-production cartridge, for reference, which contains an `A` in the code:

![Pocket Monsters: Green with sticker code 20A](/uploads/2b19157b-8cc9-4173-a8f1-c803291829fc.jpeg)

A *Red* or *Green* cartridge from the true first print runs will have a **strictly numerical** code stamped onto the cartridge sticker. There are unconfirmed reports of no code cartridges, but historically these have been an indication of a reproduction cartridge; this post will be updated if that can be confirmed.

Here's a translated [reference](https://pokemon1gb2rgbp.wiki.fc2.com/wiki/%E5%88%9D%E6%9C%9F%E7%89%88%E3%83%BB%E5%BE%8C%E6%9C%9F%E7%89%88%E3%81%AE%E9%81%95%E3%81%84) on which production codes can be found on the earliest copies of *Red*, *Green*, *Blue*, and *Yellow* versions (Blue never had "late" codes), as gathered by folks in the Japanese collecting/gaming communities:

![Early vs later stamp codes for Red & Green version cartridges](/uploads/cart-code-table.png)

While the earliest codes listed are shared among all early prints, here are strong contenders for first run codes (as determined from inserts and PCB codes). These cartridges have PCB components with date codes just a few weeks before their February launch:

* *Green*: `00`
* *Red*: `22`

According to sources for this post, Red eventually received a `00` stamp code, but this well after release (late April into May 1996).

Sometime before November, `00A` (*Green*) and `22A` (*Red*) revisions were printed for a `1.1` software version, which would also be the sole revision for *Blue* version by the end of the same year.

##### **Survey**

The most obvious indicator in the earliest printings is a survey insert only available during the first 30 days after release, and had to be postmarked by the end of March.

Ishihara-san, now President & CEO of *Game Freak,* [indicated](https://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/ds/pokemon/0/0/) that initial sales were lower than expected during the first 30 days, which explains why these surveys are relatively scarce.

![Initial release survey request](/uploads/screenshot-2024-01-07-at-11.51.46-am.png)

It translates to roughly the following:

> *Kyoto City Higashiyama Post Office P.O. Box No. 15*
>
> *Thank you for purchasing Pocket Monsters. Sorry to trouble you, we request your opinion as valuable reference for future software.*
>
> *Additionally, a lottery will be run for participants. Winners may receive:*
>
> * *(100 Winners) Pocket Monsters Guidebook*
> * *(500 Winners) Special Playing Cards*
>
> *In addition, the announcement of the winner will receive a free copy of either version. This is valid until the end of March, 1996.*

The game released in February of that year, so the 1-month deadline was for the earliest copies only.

The bottom box (featuring *Bulbasaur)* in the survey (roughly) reads:

> *It's all about Pocket Monsters!*
>
> *"Pocket Monsters Guidebook"*
>
> *– List price undecided –*
>
> *Scheduled to be released early March, 1996.*

There is no known Survey containing a *Green* production code. That's to say, sources indicate all surveys have a production code of `DMG-APAJ-JPN`, where APAJ is the *Red* version code.

## Pocket Monsters: Blue

![Pocket Monsters: Blue version, front and back](/uploads/blue-hero.jpg)

*Blue* version is unique for a few reasons. First, it started the first of a "sealed bag" treatment that would continue through *Crystal* version. It also was the first and only game to have a mail order launch before hitting retail proper.

### Mail Order Release

*Blue* version was [announced in October of 1996](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Blue_Version_(Japanese)), then [featured in CoroCoro Comic](https://lavacutcontent.com/corocoro-comic-pokemon-blue/) where readers were informed they could purchase & receive the game by mail. This initial release included a plastic bag. The application period was October 15th through December 27th of that year.

### Contents

*Blue* has notably fewer internal variations to document.

#### Box

The mail order box variant had no barcode, however the retail version did include one.

Separately, *Blue* version ended up having an exclusive *TOYOTA AUTO* promotion that featured a unique box printing, along with a tin box whose purpose is still unclear. It might have contained an accessory!

![Blue version with TOYOTA AUTO promotion](/uploads/screenshot-2024-01-07-at-3.34.43-pm.png)

It's also unclear *when* that promotion occurred.

#### Cartridge

Unlike *Red*, *Green*, or *Yellow*, *Blue* always has the same four cartridge stamp codes: `00`, `12`, `20`, and `22`, with known launch copies using `20`. There could be parallel launch codes, but that's still unclear.

#### Manual

Apart from having updated ad inserts in the years following its initial print run, *Blue* received a single manual revision, likely sometime shortly after its retail release.

The production code on the initial run is `DMG-APEJ-JPN`, and the revision is `DMG-APEJ-JPN-1`.

## Pocket Monsters: Yellow

![Pocket Monsters: Blue version, front and back](/uploads/yellow-hero.jpg)

*Yellow* version proves simple in its box variants with two distinct printings, however its cartridge is more complex .

### Seal & Box

To start, the 24-hour pre-release version came in a sealed bag with post cards, the cards being the first instance such an addition was included.

Other than the bag, the box has no difference from post-release variants.

![](/uploads/878278c8-95bc-4a0c-b73d-d5e536166372.jpeg)

The two notes in the top corner translate (roughly) to:

> 1. Get the game 1 day earlier than actual release
> 2. Get exclusive postcards only available through pre-order

Similarly, down in the bottom right corner, the preorder window is stated as `8/10 ~ 9/6`, and a pickup date of `9/11`. 

Any copy acquired this way would definitively be the earliest possible print.

There is one documented copy of this pre-release *Yellow* version that was graded by VGA as well. It came sealed in the bag, so VGA denoted it as "uncirculated" before encapsulating it. VGA returned the baggie to the owner as shown in the photo below.

### Cartridge

Like *Red* and *Green*, *Yellow* has multiple codes, some exclusive to the very earliest print run. They include `00`, `12`, `20`, and `22`.

Later print runs were quite complicated, however. Each letter in the production code indicates a full revision. Given there are codes ending in `D`, that means Yellow had at least **four** additional revisions produced.

Other than the cartridge, other contents aren't likely to have any differences despite the cartridge being updated so often. Especially considering the game's release is so late in the *Game Boy*'s lifespan.

## Additional inserts (shared between games)

Between the releases of *Blue* and *Y*ellow*,* very few changes occurred to the packaging. Mainly, the inclusion of new cartridge stamp codes (see above) and ads for *Game Boy Pocket*, *Game Boy Camera*, *Game Boy Color*, and *Nintendo 64* were added to showcase the newest Nintendo had to offer.

These newer ad inserts became present in all versions over time.

> **Note:** This is not intended to showcase print order, rather just some of the other inserts as the games aged while reprints occurred through the late 1990s. A more thorough examination of these inserts is needed to know when they first appeared and when revisions occurred

### Hardware ads
