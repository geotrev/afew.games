Late in 2022, Wata announced a new holder would be coming. I think we can all agree the new holder is a welcome change. Although I enjoy the old holder, it has some quirks that haven't scaled well, both with time and space. More than ever folks collect modern, slimmer case-style games for PS2, GameCube, Xbox, and newer consoles.

You can read Wata's [official FAQ](https://blog.watagames.com/2023/04/04/the-new-wata-holder-faq/) (released a few weeks ago) and the [subsequent announcement](https://blog.watagames.com/2023/04/20/the-new-wata-holder/) answer some common questions regarding the new cases.

In the mean time, what can you expect? Here's the cliff notes:

* There are now **six** unique case sizes (up from **four** in the legacy design).
* The key difference in the new case is it has variance in height, width, and depth, compared to the legacy holder which only had variable heights.
* Going forward, all new orders will be placed in the new holder, with the legacy design available seasonally. 

You can read more and compare the new vs old exact sizes on [this page](https://www.watagames.com/what-we-do/our-technology).

I've already submitted a test submission to reholder six games into the new holder. Stay tuned for an honest review!
