description: New holder showcases more size options, less bulk, and new label design

Late in 2022, Wata announced a new holder would be coming. I think we can all agree the new holder is a welcome change. Although I enjoy the old holder, it has some quirks that haven't scaled well, both with time and space. More than ever folks are buying slimmer case-style games, like PS2, GameCube, and Xbox.

You can read Wata's [official FAQ](https://blog.watagames.com/2023/04/04/the-new-wata-holder-faq/) (released a few weeks ago) and the [subsequent announcement](https://blog.watagames.com/2023/04/20/the-new-wata-holder/). Both should answer some common questions regarding the new cases.

In the mean time, here are some cliff notes:

* There are now **six** unique case sizes (up from **four** in the legacy design).
* The key difference in the new case is its variance in height, width, *and* depth, compared to the legacy holder which only had variable heights.
* Going forward, all new orders will be placed in the new holder, with the legacy design available seasonally.

Another useful bit of info is the exact sizes, shown on [this page](https://www.watagames.com/what-we-do/our-technology). The slimmest option is a measely 1.13" (inches). Finally, PS1 games won't look so silly!

I've already submitted a test order to update six games into the new holder. Stay tuned for an honest review!
