title: Key Wii U and 3DS Variant Identifiers
description: Trying to collect physical 3DS games? Here's your starting point
---
3DS games have been hot the last few months thanks to its *eShop* officially closing. What's more, it's starting to become speculative as collectors and resellers begin looking for key titles to hold onto for the future. Make no mistake, 3DS is fun system to collect for if you're on a bit of a budget. Most of the titles are relatively cheap, and box variants are still relatively unknown. Equip yourself with the knowledge in this article to make your collecting journey worthwhile!

> NOTE: This is the start of a new series of articles diving into console-specific game variants. Rather than focus on a specific game, these articles will cover common differentiators that can help you determine whether you're collecting an early, mid or late production copy.

## Why Do Variants Matter?

Box variants matter for a number of reasons. One of the key reasons being that some variants will contain different game content, because they may have been produced very early (or very late) in the lifespan of the title.

While I won't speculate on someone's psychology regarding collecting one print vs. another, I've noticed there is generally a pattern. 

Speculators and hardcore collectors are more likely to go for early print copies as they often have the shortest print run. This is opposed to some collectors who would prefer a later print, such as a *Nintendo Selects* edition, as they contain numerous bug fixes and sometimes additional content or DLC.

## Key Variant Indicators

Before jumping into specifics, lets cover some basics.

The Nintendo Wii U and 3DS platforms covered approximately 2011-2017. Nintendo had several big changes to its offerings in this time, including *amiibo* and a changing retail catalogue via the *eShop*. There were also general branding changes that can help identify very generally if a specific print is early, mid or late in the life span. 

* **Part Codes.** As covered my [previous](https://www.afew.games/essays/decoding-modern-nintendo-print-variants) essay, part codes are the major indicator of a print. They're only excluded for things like pack-in titles for consoles or combo offerings. While a part code doesn't represent the clearest indicator of production time, they often are predictable and safe to bet on. The major thing to remember is that five digit codes (i.e., \`12345A\`) will generally represent earlier prints. Codes with six digits (i.e., \`123456A\`) will then signify late-life prints. The last character (\`A\` in this case) is the revision, so if it's a \`B\`, \`C\`, or \`D\`, for instance, then the print will always be later regardless of the digits.
* **ESRB Rating.** At the start of both the Wii U and 3DS life, the ESRB had a slightly different design (black background and white rating). This was later changed to a white background. The ESRB officially changed branding in 2013, although some games still used the original design.

  The rating on the back of a game will also reflect this design difference.
