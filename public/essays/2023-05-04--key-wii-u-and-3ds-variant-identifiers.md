title: Key Wii U and 3DS Variant Identifiers
description: Trying to collect physical 3DS games? Here's your starting point
---
3DS games have been hot the last six months. What's more, it's starting to become speculative as collectors and resellers begin looking for key titles to hold onto for the future. Make no mistake, 3DS is fun system to collect for if you're on a bit of a budget. Most of the titles are relatively cheap, and box variants are still relatively unknown. Equip yourself with the knowledge in this article to make your collecting journey worthwhile!

> This is the start of a new series of articles diving into console-specific game variants. Rather than focus on a specific game, these articles will cover common differentiators that can help you determine whether you're collecting an early, mid or late production copy.

## Why Do Variants Matter?

Box variants matter for a number of reasons. One of the key reasons being that some variants will contain different game content, because they may have been produced very early (or very late) in the lifespan of the title.

While I won't speculate on someone's psychology regarding collecting one print vs. another, I've noticed there is generally a pattern. 

Speculators and hardcore collectors are more likely to go for early print copies as they often have the shortest print run. This is opposed to some collectors who would prefer a later print, such as a *Nintendo Selects* edition, as they contain numerous bug fixes and sometimes additional content or DLC. Then there's some collectors who want every single known print (yes, they exist).

Regardless, there's something there for everyone.

## Key Variant Indicators

Before jumping into specifics, lets cover some basics.

The Nintendo Wii U and 3DS platforms covered approximately 2011-2017. Nintendo had several big changes to its offerings in this time, including amiibo and a changing retail catalogue via the eShop. There were also general branding changes that can help identify very generally if a specific print is early, mid or late in the life span. 

* **Part Codes.** As covered in my [modern Nintendo variants essay](https://www.afew.games/essays/decoding-modern-nintendo-print-variants), part codes are the major indicator of a print. They're only excluded on occasion for pack-ins, e.g. console or controller bundle offerings. They often are predictable and safe to bet on. The major thing to remember is that five digit codes (i.e., `12345A`) should represent earlier prints. Codes with six digits (i.e., `123456A`) will often signify later prints. The last character (e.g., `A`) is the revision, so if the code has `B`, `C`, or `D`, for instance, then the print will always be later regardless of the numeric portion.
* **ESRB Rating.** At the start of both the Wii U and 3DS life, the ESRB had a slightly different design. They officially [changed branding in 2013](https://logos.fandom.com/wiki/Entertainment_Software_Rating_Board/Ratings#2003%E2%80%932013), although some games still used the original design as they were already in production or had finished production prior and were about to release. The rating on the back of a given game generally reflects the correct design. For obvious reasons, games produced after 2013-2014 are likely to have only the new design.

* **Nintendo Network vs. amiibo.** Around the end of 2014, Nintendo launched amiibo for added hardware features in select games. Games such as *Mario Kart 8* and *Animal Crossing New Leaf*, received slightly modified art after amiibo's launch. Let's use the former as an example:

  I have a more in depth example for *Mario Kart 8* in my [Wii U population report analysis](https://deploy-preview-209--afewgames.netlify.app/essays/wata-games-pop-report-analysis-wii-u).
* **Nintendo Selects**. Starting with the *Wii*, Nintendo Selects replaced Player's Choice for games that sold more than 1 million units at retail. Here is a [full list of games](https://nintenfan.com/other/complete-list-nintendo-selects-wii-u-3ds-wii.html) for Wii U, 3DS, and Wii.
* **Not For Resale (NFR).** This designation is mainly for games packaged in bundles, like *Super Smash Bros for Wii U*, which received a [controller bundle treatment](https://www.vg247.com/super-smash-bros-wii-u-gamecube-controller). Another highly sought after example is *The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D*, which had a very early [system bundle edition](https://www.zeldadungeon.net/ocarina-of-time-3ds-bundle-official-press-release/) with a physical copy of the game. It's not only very rare today, but a confirmed early print of the game.

## Conclusion

In short, you can use the above details to better discern when a game you're holding was produced for your own purposes.

If there's one key take away I give you though, it's to not rely on *just one* detail to determine the chronology of a variant. You will almost certainly need to leverage part codes and box art in addition to comparing with other known variants to accurately determine the print you have and/or want.

Thanks for reading!
