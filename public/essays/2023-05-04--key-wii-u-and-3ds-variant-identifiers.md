title: "Key Variant Identifiers: Wii U and 3DS"
description: Learn the ins and outs of what distinguishes print runs of these modern games
---
Nintendo 3DS games have been on fire in the secondary market over the last six months. What's more, these games have entered into speculation, as collectors and resellers begin looking for key titles to hold onto for the future. Currently, many of its titles are relatively cheap, and box variants are still relatively unknown despite its age (12 years!).

Simlarly, Wii U has become the trendy among set collectors for its extremely very small library (only 205 physical games). Despite its poor performance at retail, Wii U has some iconic games that have since been re-released on Switch to explosive success.

If you are going to collect for these two consoles, equip yourself with the knowledge in this article to enhance your collecting journey!

> "Key Variant Identifiers" is the start of a new series of articles diving into console-specific game variants. Rather than focus on a specific game, these articles will show common variant denominators across a library of games.

## Terminology

Here is a quick glossary on common terms/acronyms:

* **UPC:** Universal Product Code. This is the bar code on the back of most games that is used for categorizing games at retail.
* **Part Code:** A five or six digit code near the UPC. It's common on most modern 1st- and 2nd-party Nintendo games.
* **Print:** Refers to the numeric portion of a game's part code. For instance, a game with part code `12345B` will have the print `12345`.
* **Variant (or Revision):** Refers to the alpha-numeric portion of a game's part code. Typically it's a letter and the last character. For instance, a game with part code `12345B` has the revision `B`.
* **ESRB:** The Entertainment Software Ratings Board. They provide ratings for games similar to how movies are rated.

## Why Do Variants Matter?

Box variants matter for a number of reasons. One of the key reasons being that some variants will contain different game content, because they may have been produced very early (or very late) in the lifespan of the title.

While I won't speculate on someone's psychology regarding collecting one print vs. another, I've noticed there is generally a pattern. 

Speculators and hardcore collectors are more likely to go for early print copies as they often have the shortest print run. This is opposed to some collectors who would prefer a later print, such as a *Nintendo Selects* edition, as they contain numerous bug fixes and sometimes additional content or DLC. Then there's some collectors who want every single known print (yes, they exist).

Regardless, there's something there for everyone.

## Key Variant Indicators

The Nintendo Wii U and 3DS platforms covered approximately 2011-2017. Nintendo had several big changes to its offerings in this time, including amiibo and a changing retail catalogue via the eShop. There were also general branding changes that can help identify very generally if a specific print is early, mid or late in the life span. 

### Part Codes

As covered in my [modern Nintendo variants essay](https://www.afew.games/essays/decoding-modern-nintendo-print-variants), part codes are the major indicator of a print. They're only excluded on occasion for pack-ins, e.g. console or controller bundle offerings. They often are predictable and safe to bet on.

The code is always on the back near the UPC. In the below example, the part code is `83663A`.

There are two major things to remember:

1. The last character (always alpha-numeric). If it ends with the letter `A`, then the print you're holding is the original variant of the given print. If it's not the letter `A`, the letter always descends alphabetically for each time the game had to be revised for production, for instance for fixing mistakes or adding feature text (e.g., amiibo support).
2. Second is five vs six digit codes. For five digits (i.e., `12345A`) that will represent an earlier print, or a variant of an early print (if the code doesn't end in `A`). Codes with six digits (i.e., `123456A`) will often signify later prints, regardless of revision.

### ESRB Rating

At the start of both the Wii U and 3DS life, the ESRB had a slightly different design. They officially [changed branding in 2013](https://logos.fandom.com/wiki/Entertainment_Software_Rating_Board/Ratings#2003%E2%80%932013), although some games still used the original design as they were already in production or had finished production prior and were about to release. The rating on the back of a given game generally reflects the correct design. For obvious reasons, games produced after 2013-2014 are likely to have only the new design.

### Nintendo Network vs. amiibo

Around the end of 2014, Nintendo launched amiibo for added hardware features in select games. Games such as *Mario Kart 8* and *Animal Crossing New Leaf*, received slightly modified art after amiibo's launch. Let's use the former as an example:

I have a more in depth example for *Mario Kart 8* in my [Wii U population report analysis](https://deploy-preview-209--afewgames.netlify.app/essays/wata-games-pop-report-analysis-wii-u).

### Nintendo Selects

Starting with the *Wii*, Nintendo Selects replaced Player's Choice for games that sold more than 1 million units at retail. Here is a [full list of games](https://nintenfan.com/other/complete-list-nintendo-selects-wii-u-3ds-wii.html) for Wii U, 3DS, and Wii.

### Not For Resale (NFR)

This designation is mainly for games packaged in bundles, like *Super Smash Bros for Wii U*, which received a [controller bundle treatment](https://www.vg247.com/super-smash-bros-wii-u-gamecube-controller). Another highly sought after example is *The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D*, which had a very early [system bundle edition](https://www.zeldadungeon.net/ocarina-of-time-3ds-bundle-official-press-release/) with a physical copy of the game. It's not only very rare today, but a confirmed early print of the game.

## Conclusion

In short, you can use the above details to better discern when a game you're holding was produced for your own purposes.

If there's one key take away I give you though, it's to not rely on *just one* detail to determine the chronology of a variant. You will almost certainly need to leverage part codes and box art in addition to comparing with other known variants to accurately determine the print you have and/or want.

Thanks for reading!
