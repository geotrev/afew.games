description: This data won't surprise you (guaranteed)

As a continuation of the last breakdown for GameCube population data, now we'll take a closer look at Wii and see how grades and submissions broke down over the last few years. Unsurprisingly, there are a lot of obvious choices for most submitted game, namely Super Smash Bros. Brawl and Super Mario Galaxy. But more on that later.

As a caveat to the below data, remember: games submitted to Wata won't and will never be able to represent the wider collecting hobby. This is mainly due to the fact that graded games and its community(ies) of enthusiasts are still very small when compared to the larger collecting sphere. The motivations of grading are at least partially skewed by the highest value and/or sought-after games too.

Same as in previous essays, we'll break down each console into a few metrics:

- Seal grade totals
- Box grade totals (starting at `9.0`) (new!)
- Seal grade breakdown across each box grade, starting at `9.0`
- The top 10 submitted games

Seal grades show a strong weight on A+, similar to other consoles.

| Seal Grade | Total | %      |
| ---------- | ----- | ------ |
| A++        | 344   | 11.47% |
| A+         | 1736  | 57.91% |
| A          | 781   | 26.05% |
| B+         | 118   | 3.94%  |
| B          | 16    | 0.53%  |
| C+         | 1     | 0.03%  |
| C          | 0     | 0.00%  |
| NS         | 2     | 0.07%  |
| Total      | 2998  | 100%   |

Box grades also weight heavily to the 9.4-9.6 range.

| Box Grade | Total | %      |
| --------- | ----- | ------ |
| 10        | 0     | 0.00%  |
| 9.8       | 329   | 10.97% |
| 9.6       | 1067  | 35.59% |
| 9.4       | 865   | 28.85% |
| 9.2       | 395   | 13.18% |
| 9.0       | 166   | 5.54%  |
| Total     | 2822  | 100%   |

Breaking down those box grades across seal grades, there is a predictable pattern where the main outcomes land between 9.4-9.6 A+

| Box Grade         | A++    | A+     | A      | B+    | B     | C+    | C     | NS    |
| ----------------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 10                | 0      | 0      | 0      | 0     | 0     | 0     | 0     | 0     |
| 9.8               | 147    | 168    | 12     | 2     | 0     | 0     | 0     | 0     |
| 9.6               | 134    | 761    | 160    | 10    | 1     | 1     | 0     | 0     |
| 9.4               | 47     | 551    | 242    | 24    | 1     | 0     | 0     | 0     |
| 9.2               | 8      | 160    | 195    | 24    | 7     | 0     | 0     | 1     |
| 9.0               | 3      | 57     | 88     | 17    | 1     | 0     | 0     | 0     |
| Seal Total        | 339    | 1697   | 697    | 77    | 10    | 1     | 0     | 1     |
| % of Total Graded | 11.31% | 56.60% | 23.25% | 2.57% | 0.33% | 0.03% | 0.00% | 0.03% |
