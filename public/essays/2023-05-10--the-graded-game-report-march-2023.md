description: Summary of changes, from population reports to community

I'm a little late on this one, but I think you'll enjoy the results. Wata Games has been publishing updates to their population reports about once every 3-4 months consistently, and it's probably good form at this point to start sharing exactly how the numbers and trends are shifting. We'll also dover some other happenings near the end.

Let's cover the data first. Of the consoles currently available in the pop report (which excludes PS3, Xbox One/X/S, Switch, PSP, Vita, 3DS, etc), there were 2716 \[1] new certifications (games) added. Pretty low, but the market is small. For comparison, PSA slabbed and shipped 1.22 million (yes, million) newly certified items across all verticals.

Here's a more detailed breakdown of additions to Wata Games' census as a breakdown of box grades:

| Box Grade | Census Total | Certifications Added |
| --------- | ------------ | -------------------- |
| 10        | 44           | +10                  |
| 9.8       | 10314        | +430                 |
| 9.6       | 20467        | +706                 |
| 9.4       | 16494        | +510                 |
| 9.2       | 8431         | +281                 |
| 9.0       | 5380         | +242                 |
| 8.5       | 6446         | +239                 |
| 8.0       | 4195         | +116                 |
| 7.5       | 3213         | +86                  |
| 7.0       | 1789         | +39                  |
| 6.5       | 1099         | +23                  |
| <6.5      | 1222         | +32                  |
| Total     | 79094        | +2714 \[1]           |

A look at seal grades reflects a pattern of grade distribution that should look familiar. The most common grade added is `A+`, with `A` close behind:

| Box Grade | Census Total | Certifications Added |
| --------- | ------------ | -------------------- |
| 10        | 44           | +10                  |
| 9.8       | 10314        | +430                 |
| 9.6       | 20467        | +706                 |
| 9.4       | 16494        | +510                 |
| 9.2       | 8431         | +281                 |
| 9.0       | 5380         | +242                 |
| 8.5       | 6446         | +239                 |
| 8.0       | 4195         | +116                 |
| 7.5       | 3213         | +86                  |
| 7.0       | 1789         | +39                  |
| 6.5       | 1099         | +23                  |
| <6.5      | 1222         | +32                  |
| Total     | 79070        | +2716 \[1]           |

Totals added per console also reveal an interesting pattern. Included here is the number of certifications added since the previous updates, for reference. 

**\*Note:** I've included only Nintendo, Playstation, and Xbox totals for brevity and relevance.*

| Platform | Aug. 1st, 2022 | Dec. 1st, 2022 | Mar. 1st, 2023 |
| -------- | -------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| NES      | 11522          | 12247 (+725)   | 12496 (+249)   |
| SNES     | 5239           | 5684 (+445)    | 5817 (+133)    |
| N64      | 4426           | 4868 (+442)    | 5093 (+225)    |
| GameCube | \-             | 3749           | 3886 (+137)    |
| Wii      | \-             | 2998           | 3043 (+45)     |
| Wii U    | \-             | 1744           | 1808 (+64)     |
| GB       | 2485           | 2679 (+194)    | 2770 (+91)     |
| GBC      | 1510           | 1627 (+117)    | 1717 (+90)     |
| GBA      | 3013           | 3406 (+393)    | 3560 (+154)    |
| PS1      | 6282           | 7054 (+772)    | 7295 (+241)    |
| PS2      | \-             | 9879           | 10356 (+477)   |
| Xbox     | \-             | 2836           | 2988 (+152)    |
| Xbox 360 | \-             | 4057           | 4392 (+335)    |

Largely, the top 10 submitted games for each console are similar to the previous submission window (8/2022 to 12/2022).

If we use August thru December of 2022 as the comparative submission rate, then some consoles, such as NES and SNES, have seen well into a 60-70% drop. It doesn't appear that any console, with the exception of the modern consoles missing an August population, had an increase in submission rate.

While the cause isn't clear, there are several factors, including a generally down macro-economic environment (starting in 2022), which has resulted in most markets being down (stock market, crypto, etc).

It's worth noting that at least Collector's Universe PWCC have had layoffs in the last month, so it remains a challenging environment in most respects.

\[1] *There is a tiny discrepancy in total certifications added between box grades and seal grades. This happened because Wata has invalid entries in its data for a handful of box and seal grades. The above data is otherwise largely reflective of the public census.*

## Other Happenings

A new resource is in town! Coming soon is Gamer Stonks (GS), a helpful sales and population tool. It combines sales from multiple auction houses and populations from Wata and CGC.

***Disclaimer:** I have prerelease access to GS, and it makes life so much easier. This isn't a paid endorsement.*

There's also a handful of great auctions coming up, including Heritage Auctions' [8-64 bit showcase](https://comics.ha.com/c/search-results.zx?N=6717+793+794+791+1893+792+2088+6437+4294939790&ic=Items-OpenAuctions-Open-BrowseCatalog-051914) and CertifiedLink's [Spring Auction](https://www.certifiedlink.com/auctions/default.asp?Focused=1&view=2023aprcert). These are among my favorite types of auctions as they showcase old *and* modern games.
