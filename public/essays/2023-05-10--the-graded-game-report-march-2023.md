description: Summary of updates from Wata Games' March population update
---
I'm a little late on this one, but I think you'll enjoy the results. Wata Games has been publishing updates to their population reports about once every 3-4 months consistently, and it's probably good form at this point to start sharing exactly how the numbers and trends are shifting.

Let's cover the high level first. Of the consoles currently available in the pop report (which excludes PS3, Xbox One/X/S, Switch, PSP, Vita, 3DS, etc), there were 2716 \[1] new certifications (games) added. Pretty low, but the market is small. For comparison, PSA slabbed and shipped 1.22 million (yes, million) newly certified items across all verticals.

Here's a more detailed breakdown of additions to Wata Games' census as a breakdown of box grades:

| Box Grade | Census Total | Certifications Added |
| --------- | ------------ | -------------------- |
| 10        | 44           | +10                  |
| 9.8       | 10314        | +430                 |
| 9.6       | 20467        | +706                 |
| 9.4       | 16494        | +510                 |
| 9.2       | 8431         | +281                 |
| 9.0       | 5380         | +242                 |
| 8.5       | 6446         | +239                 |
| 8.0       | 4195         | +116                 |
| 7.5       | 3213         | +86                  |
| 7.0       | 1789         | +39                  |
| 6.5       | 1099         | +23                  |
| <6.5      | 1222         | +32                  |
| Total     | 79094        | +2714 \[1]           |

A look at seal grades reflects a pattern of grade distribution that should look familiar. The most common grade added is `A+`, with `A` close behind:

| Box Grade | Census Total | Certifications Added |
| --------- | ------------ | -------------------- |
| 10        | 44           | +10                  |
| 9.8       | 10314        | +430                 |
| 9.6       | 20467        | +706                 |
| 9.4       | 16494        | +510                 |
| 9.2       | 8431         | +281                 |
| 9.0       | 5380         | +242                 |
| 8.5       | 6446         | +239                 |
| 8.0       | 4195         | +116                 |
| 7.5       | 3213         | +86                  |
| 7.0       | 1789         | +39                  |
| 6.5       | 1099         | +23                  |
| <6.5      | 1222         | +32                  |
| Total     | 79070        | +2716 \[1]           |

Totals added per console also reveal an interesting pattern. Included here is the number of certifications added since the previous updates, for reference. 

**\*Note:** I've included only Nintendo, Playstation, and Xbox totals for brevity and relevance.*

\[1] *There is a tiny discrepancy in total certifications added between box grades and seal grades. This happened because Wata has invalid entries in its data for a handful of box and seal grades. The above data is otherwise largely reflective of the public census.*
