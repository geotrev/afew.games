title: Pocket Monsters Red & Green Variant Guide
description: Detailed print variant breakdown of the first games in the Pocket
  Monsters franchise
---
Greetings friends! This post is a researched guide on what I currently think are the various components & print combinations of *Pocket Monsters Red & Green*. As time goes on, I will update it as new information is presented & discussed in the collecting community. 

I hope you find it useful!

*NOTE: This post is supplemental to the database. To see a list of first generation* Pocket Monsters *print variants as they exist on A Few Games, [view them here](https://www.afew.games/?search=pocket+monsters&platform=game+boy). A full list of sources can be found at the end of this post.*

## Box Variants

* First/early prints have large UPC
* Later prints (mid-1996 onward) have smaller UPC

## Cartridge Variants

Cartridges can be dated with a combination of label code, chip codes, and the PCB date module.

### Label Codes

Label codes have a two or three digit production code on bottom right corner. [[source](https://pokemon1gb2rgbp.wiki.fc2.com/wiki/%E5%88%9D%E6%9C%9F%E7%89%88%E3%83%BB%E5%BE%8C%E6%9C%9F%E7%89%88%E3%81%AE%E9%81%95%E3%81%84)] 

|           | Earliest Known | Early  | Mid/Late |
| --------- | -------------- | ------ | -------- |
| **Red**   | 22             | 00, 20 | XXA      |
| **Green** | 00             | 20     | XXA      |

### PCB Codes

PCBs use gold blocks to indicate dates.

|           | Earliest Known | Pre-Launch |
| --------- | -------------- | ---------- |
| **Red**   | Nov. 1995      | Jan. 1996  |
| **Green** | Nov. 1995      | Jan. 1996  |

The PCB dates use the below block format, from top right (January) to bottom left (December). The production date is the last un-punched dot.

### Chip Codes

Chip codes use a different date format.

* Newest code across components is nearest time of production (regardless of Mask ROM date)

  * Parts include CIC, SRAM, battery, and Mask ROM
* `YY` = Year, e.g. 96 (1996)
* `WW` = Week, e.g. 06 (mid-February)

## Manual Variants

* `JPN` (1996-1999) used until 1999-2000
* `JPN-1` removes date code and changes customer support number

![Manual changes from early/mid to late prints.](/uploads/manual-red.png)

Inner pages seem to only show the last page as changing. It has a date code for each year it was printed/revised.

Known codes (`YYMMDD` format):

* No code
* `970530` 
* `980218` 
* `990630` 
* `001122` 

Although unconfirmed, there are likely multiple date codes used during a given year.

`JPN-1` marks the final design used for the manual in 2000.

## Correlated Parts

Part combinations apply uniformly between Red and Green. There may still be missing combinations. This is a "best guess" given date codes and approximate time-frame of when the inserts were used, and is based on a large survey of listings on *Yahoo! Japan Auctions*, *Mercari*, and *eBay*.

\**There is some anecdotal evidence at launch for small UPCs made in parallel, but large UPCs are guaranteed for first production.*

*\*\*`X` designation is a placeholder for digits. E.g., `XXA` could be `00A`.*
