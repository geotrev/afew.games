title: Pocket Monsters Red & Green Variant Guide
description: Detailed print variant breakdown of the first games in the Pocket
  Monsters franchise
---
Greetings friends! This post is a researched guide on what I currently think are the various components & print combinations of *Pocket Monsters Red & Green*. As time goes on, I will update it as new information is presented & discussed in the collecting community. 

I hope you find it useful!

*NOTE: This post is supplemental to the database. To see a list of first generation* Pocket Monsters *print variants as they exist on A Few Games, [view them here](https://www.afew.games/?search=pocket+monsters&platform=game+boy). A full list of sources can be found at the end of this post.*

## Box Variants

* First/early prints have large UPC
* Later prints (mid-1996 onward) have smaller UPC
* No other changes

### Cartridge Variants

Cartridges can be dated with a combination of label production code, chip date codes, and PCB production date code.

Stamp codes have a two or three digit production code on bottom right corner. [[source](https://pokemon1gb2rgbp.wiki.fc2.com/wiki/%E5%88%9D%E6%9C%9F%E7%89%88%E3%83%BB%E5%BE%8C%E6%9C%9F%E7%89%88%E3%81%AE%E9%81%95%E3%81%84)] 

|       | Earliest Known | Early  | Mid/Late |
| ----- | -------------- | ------ | -------- |
| Red   | 22             | 00, 20 | XXA      |
| Green | 00             | 20     | XXA      |

PCBs use gold blocks to indicate dates.

|       | Earliest Known | Pre-Launch |
| ----- | -------------- | ---------- |
| Red   | Nov. 1995      | Jan. 1996  |
| Green | Nov. 1995      | Jan. 1996  |

The PCB dates use the below block format, from top right (January) to bottom left (December). The production date is the last un-punched dot.

Chip codes use a different date format.

* Newest code across components is nearest time of production (regardless of Mask ROM date)

  * Parts include CIC, SRAM, battery, and Mask ROM
* `YY` = Year, e.g. 96 (1996)
* `WW` = Week, e.g. 06 (mid-February)

## Manual Variants

* `JPN` (1996-1999) and `JPN-1` (~2000) codes
* `JPN-1` removes date code and changes customer support number

Inner pages seem to only show the last page as changing. It has a date code for each year it was printed/revised.

Known codes (`YYMMDD` format):

* No code
* `970530`
* `980218`
* `990630`
* `001122`

The final page on the 2000 reprint contains several layout changes, as indicated with arrows.
