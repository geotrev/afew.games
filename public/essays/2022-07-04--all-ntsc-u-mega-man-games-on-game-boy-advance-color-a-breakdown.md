It's no secret that Mega Man is a huge IP spanning decades, with dozens and dozens of games. If you're a set collector or just want to collect every entry on the Game Boy Color and Advance systems, then this post is for you.

## Preface

Before we jump into the list, here are some base expectations:

* Each game covered will show a cart, manual, precautions booklet, and cardboard inlay/tray. There are exceptions that will be noted when appropriate (such as ads or postcards).
* Differences in paperwork, such as copy quirks or print codes, aren't noted here (but may be added in the future).
* When appropriate, major visual differences will be highlighted.

If you have questions, comments, or corrections to note, please don't be shy and drop me a line at [contact@afew.games](mailto:contact@afew.games). Information like this can only be made whole when information is fully collated!

Credits are at the end for contributions.
