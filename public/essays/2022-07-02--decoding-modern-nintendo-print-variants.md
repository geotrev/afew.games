title: Decoding Modern Nintendo Print Variants
description: Gone are the days of memorizing every dot on a box; in are the days
  of standardized print data!

With the release of the Nintendo Wii and DS, Nintendo made identifying game prints much easier. While they still use(d) major revision differences in "player's choice," they also introduced two new data points in the form of UPC satellite codes and print (variant) codes. These are typically positioned very close to the game's primary UPC on the back of a case/box.

Thankfully, these codes have persisted even to the most recent generation of games (Nintendo Switch).

In this article, I'll show you how to read this information on your game to identify the exact print run you own, including its region of manufacture and intended locale!

## Game Data Breakdown

Let's start with _Hyrule Warriros_ on the Switch as a reference:

Let's explain these details a bit:

- **Print (variant) code:** This is a unique identifier for the specific iteration of a game. For first and second party Nintendo games, this is a numerical value (five to six digits) representing the form of the game (e.g., retail standalone, limited edition, etc), followed by a single letter suffix, indicating the production revision. The revision suffix will always be in order, starting at `A` (first print), then to `B`, and so on.
- **Satellite code**: A simple five-digit code denoting the region of production (third digit) and iteration of the game (0, 1, 2, etc). You'll often see the revision suffix in the print code correlate to this value, but not always.
- **Model Part # (MPN)**: Similar to the print code, this is a custom code used to track the game on the open market. What's useful for our purposes is that it also denotes the intended region of distribution, e.g., `USA` (USA specific), `USZ` (USA and Canada/Mexico), and/or `CAN` (Canada).
- **Region of manufacture**: The physical location the game was manufactured in. For many games, that's Japan. This should match the middle digit of the satellite code, although there are exceptions (we'll cover that in a few moments).

## A Note About Print Codes

No, the lowest print code (not the alpha-numeric suffix, but the number) won't always indicate that a specific game model/version was released before all the others.

The most important factor in the print is noting how the game was distributed. For instance, if a game was distributed as part of a bundle, its print code is completely different, and will have a separate set of revisions against it. Or no revisions at all.

Likewise, a retail copy that is distributed standalone, as most games are, will have its own code as well. Often games are released side-by-side as retail standalone as well as in a bundle, so it's harder to nail down the first print.

All of this is to say: sometimes there are several "first prints," like in the case of The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening for Switch, which had both a standalone retail release AND a bundle release (called the "Dreamer Edition"), which has a Not For Resale (NFR) copy of the game inside the outer box.

## Examples

Let's say your game has the below information.

You would read this as: **retail second print, made in Japan, distributed in USA.**

Since this is the standalone retail copy of this game, it won't have competing print codes unless the game packaging design is drastically changed (e.g., bonus DLC included, or a NFR version) or it's locale is altered (for instance, for United Arab Emerates or UAE, which is also a retail print, but not intended for the Americas).

Here are additional examples on various Nintendo consoles. It's always the same combination of data, but laid out slightly different.

### Nintendo DS

### Nintendo 3DS

### Nintendo Wii

### Nintendo Wii U

## Errors, Inconsistencies, and Bundles

Like all things, there have been and will be exceptions/mistakes where games are printed with the wrong codes but the error was noticed too late in the production process, resulting in "error" copies. Similarly, third parties don't always respect Nintendo's print/satellite code pattern.

Let's look at some examples.

On _Kingdom Hearts: 358/2 Days_ for Nintendo DS (third party developed and published), Square Enix omitted the revision suffix in the print code and entirely omitted the satellite code.

![Some third party publishers, like Square Enix, won't fully honor the print/satellite code system and will omit some or all of that data](/uploads/kingdom-hearts.jpg)

On _Bayonetta 2_ for Wii U (2nd party developed), there is a `00000` satellite code accompanied by "Made in USA." According to [ModernDB](https://www.instagram.com/Moderndatabase/), it was common for the developer to make this mistake on their games.

And in case you're worried that big box bundles don't have these codes, fear not. While they may not have a satellite code, they should still include print codes and an MPN. The game inside will have a unique print code and revision set as well.

On Super Smash Bros for Wii U (controller bundle) for example we see the MPN and print code but no satellite code.

## A Word on Market Preference & Prices

I'm not going to pretend that there isn't a tendency for collectors to prefer NTSC-U (USA) copies of games. It has been and continues to be the norm.

For this reason, I think it's important to know these details so you don't overpay for a game the market sees as "less valuable." At the same time, if you find a "valuable" print for a low price, well, you nailed it!

All in all, finding new copies of certain modern games will be a challenge as more resellers at large are seeing NTSC-U, first-print print codes as the key to profit. Especially with modern game grading becoming as prevalent as it is (akin to comics and sports cards).

We're seeing this market activity happen on games as modern as Super Mario Odyssey, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and Super Smash Bros Ultimate. Will it last into the future? Who knows, but knowing what you're buying will better inform you.

To work around this, you'll see an immense discount when finding CAN or even MX (Mexico) variants of your favorite games. In this case, often these regional games still have English options and will play all the same!

## Conclusion

I hope this has been a helpful introduction to the concept of modern Nintendo game print variants. There really isn't any magic here!

Like all things data-based, though, if you can't find information online, you can always hit up eBay and compile a list of print codes by scanning active listing photos. I've begun keeping a spreadsheet for each game I document, noting all the information we've discussed above, plus any significant packaging differences (e.g., multi-language, DLC features, bonus content, etc).
